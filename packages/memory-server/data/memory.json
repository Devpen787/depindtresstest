            "content": "This thesis evaluates the robustness of DePIN tokenomic mechanisms under standardized stress conditions using a reproducible, simulation-based framework. It argues that DePIN systems are Cyber-Physical Systems where hardware sunk costs create a 'Moat' that prevents immediate churn during price drops, but at the cost of latent capacity degradation. The goal is to move from 'Forecasting' to 'Stress Testing' using the Onocoy network as a case study.",

            "content": "The 'Sunk Cost Moat' theory posits that the high upfront capital expenditure and installation friction of DePIN hardware (e.g., roof-mounted antennas) acts as a retention buffer. This friction prevents immediate churn during price crashes (unlike liquid DeFi assets) but leads to 'Latent Capacity Degradation' where new growth freezes and maintenance suffers.",
