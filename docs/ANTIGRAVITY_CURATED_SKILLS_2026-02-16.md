# Antigravity Curated Skills (DePIN Repo)

This repository uses a focused subset of ideas from:

- https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills

## Selection Goals

- Keep only skills directly useful for DePIN simulation and optimizer work.
- Prefer skills with explicit trigger conditions and verification behavior.
- Adapt instructions to this repo's real commands and file paths.

## Included Local Skills

1. `depin-simulation-optimizer`
   - Deterministic diagnostics for optimizer outputs and sensitivity behavior.
   - Path: `skills/depin-simulation-optimizer/SKILL.md`
2. `depin-systematic-debugging`
   - Root-cause-first bug workflow for model and optimizer regressions.
   - Path: `skills/depin-systematic-debugging/SKILL.md`
3. `depin-verification-before-completion`
   - Completion gate requiring fresh command evidence.
   - Path: `skills/depin-verification-before-completion/SKILL.md`
4. `depin-model-change-tdd`
   - Test-first workflow for model math and optimizer behavior changes.
   - Path: `skills/depin-model-change-tdd/SKILL.md`
5. `depin-planning-with-files`
   - File-based working memory for complex multi-phase tasks.
   - Path: `skills/depin-planning-with-files/SKILL.md`

## Upstream Skills Used As Bases

- `systematic-debugging`
- `verification-before-completion`
- `test-driven-development`
- `planning-with-files`

All local variants include repository-specific commands and constraints.
