# Side Mission Plan: Red-Team Revamp Integration Bridge

## Goal
Append a skeptical, evidence-cited audit to docs/REVAMP_INTEGRATION_BRIDGE.md covering narrative flow, KPI ownership, labels/confidence, decision brief contract, and feasibility.

## Phases
1. Collect repo-grounded evidence with line refs.
2. Falsify core revamp assumptions and draft risks/rejections.
3. Define kill tests and decision table.
4. Append prioritized integration advice and finalize artifact.
