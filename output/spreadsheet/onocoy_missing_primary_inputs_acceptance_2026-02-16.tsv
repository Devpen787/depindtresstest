M1	Can we directly measure spoofing detections from the dashboard today?	N	Sandbox > Onocoy Hook Layer > Integrity Pressure > Missing Primary Inputs	Required: spoofingDetections; current output: integrityProxy.spoofingRatePct with spoofingDetections hardcoded to 0 fallback	N/A (primary spoofing telemetry not wired)	Onocoy data contact (security/integrity telemetry owner)	Derived from onocoyHookSnapshot.missingInputs + buildOnocoyHookSnapshot() and deriveOnocoyIntegritySignals() wiring in src/hooks/useSimulationRunner.ts
M2	Can we directly measure slashing-event counts from the dashboard today?	N	Sandbox > Onocoy Hook Layer > Integrity Pressure > Missing Primary Inputs	Required: slashingEvents; current output: integrityProxy.slashingRatePct with slashingEvents hardcoded to 0 fallback	N/A (primary slashing telemetry not wired)	Onocoy data contact (security/integrity telemetry owner)	Derived from onocoyHookSnapshot.missingInputs + buildOnocoyHookSnapshot() and deriveOnocoyIntegritySignals() wiring in src/hooks/useSimulationRunner.ts
M3	Can we use canonical on-chain/token-plan unlock events instead of scenario proxy unlocks?	N	Sandbox > Onocoy Hook Layer > Unlock Curve > Missing Primary Inputs	Required: canonicalUnlockEvents (vesting/contract schedule); current output: buildOnocoyUnlockCurve() scenario proxy	Event-level unlock timeline (cliff + stream by date/week)	Onocoy tokenomics / treasury ops owner	Derived from onocoyHookSnapshot.missingInputs and unlockSource='proxy' in buildOnocoyHookSnapshot(), which uses buildOnocoyUnlockCurve() model scaffold
