But Investors Have Major Misconceptions about DePIN: They’re Operating on Outdated Data.DePINs in 2021 were: - Pre-revenue (<$1M ARR), demand-constrained - Unsustainably unprofitable (high inflation) - Unbelievably overvalued (>1000x multiples) - Growth driven by retail speculation
DePINs in 2025 are: - Revenue-generating ($72M in 2025), supply-constrained - Sustainably profitable, with little or no supply inflation - Undervalued relative to growth, with 10-25x multiples - Growth driven by utility and efficiencies, not subsidies

It’s Not All Investors’ Fault: Most DePIN Founders are Playing Last Cycle’s Games.In 2025, (almost) every DePIN has…- Supply-side growth and a “passionate” community- $1M+ ARR “but our revenue isn’t verifiable yet”- An “ecosystem” of “partners” for co-marketing- CEXs “interested” to launch the token “next quarter”
…But only the leading DePINs have:- Miners that make money from paid usage, not incentives- Revenues that benefit tokenholders and/or stakers- Customers who spend more each month, i.e. net retention- A low-cost of way of financing deployments, i.e. InfraFi

Today, Only ~Three Viable Paths Remain for Scaling a DePIN Globally and Sustainably.You can’t escape physics: building physical infrastructure requires lots of capital.- Path 1: InfraFi. Enable stablecoin-holders (with $300B+ of supply outstanding) to earn yield by financing physical infrastructure assets. - Path 2: Capex-light. Focus on infrastructure that requires relatively little capex ($Ms globally, not $Bs), and can be monetized quickly.- Path 3: Bull market timing. Launch a token during a generational bull market when interest rates are near zero.

A Few DePINs (Should We Call Them That?)are Pioneering InfraFi… Combining DePIN + DeFi.InfraFi: What?InfraFi: Why? InfraFi: Who?Historically, DePINs harnessed the speculative premium on utility tokens to finance infrastructure buildouts. The math worked in 2020-2021, when the market cap of crypto alts rose from $50B to $950B.
In 2024-2025, the speculative premium on most alts has disappeared. Instead, users minted $175B+ of stablecoins, including $12B+ yield-bearing stables.
InfraFi allows stablecoin holders to earn yield by financing physical infrastructure by simply depositing and/or staking stablecoins into a vault.Funds in the vault are used to finance the purchase and/or deployment of infrastructure assets (e.g., GPUs, solar panels, batteries, radios).Revenues generated (or debt accrued) by the infrastructure are (re)paid into the vault. Depositors redeem stablecoins plus their share of the yield.Key Challenges of InfraFiDuration mismatch: infrastructure cannot be liquidated in a hurry if/when stablecoin holders redeem en masse.Credit risk: physical infrastructure get broken, stolen, or otherwise impaired causing a loss of principal.Principal-agent problems: between the underwriters of infrastructure assets and stablecoin depositors/lenders.
ComputeUSDai earns yield on loans secured by GPUs in datacenters.Since launching in mid-2025, USDai has grown to $685M+ of user deposits (TVL).
EnergyDaylight earns yield on energy assets (solar panels & batteries) by selling power to homeowners and to the electric grid.

Helium: the Bull and Bear Case.
Bandwidth
PMF is firmly validated and Helium is now in its scaling phase.Helium demonstrated strong adoption in 2025 with network DAUs up ~170% (900Kto 2.5M) and Helium Mobile subscriptions up ~385% (125K to 600K). ⇒ Growth is not slowing down, suggesting a path to $25-50M revenue in 2026.Carrier offload is becoming Helium’s primary revenue engine.Carrier offoad revenues – primarily from T-Mobile and AT&T – scaled rapidly in 2025, growing ~14x throughout the year from $2.5K to $35K+ per day.⇒ Even without Helium Mobile-related economics, HNT will soon be deflationary.International expansion represents massive upside with large TAM.Helium is expanding internationally to millions of users in Mexico (via Movistar partnership + Inversion Capital) and in Brazil (via Mambo partnership).⇒  International adoption can drive revenue growth rates even higher than in the US.
What are these, margins for ants?Helium set pricing at $0.50 per GB in 2021 based on market rates for CBRS.WiFi offload, which Helium pivoted to in 2024, is worth only $0.10-$0.25 per GB. ⇒ HNT’s current onchain revenue overstates offload earnings power by 2-5x. Who actually owns Helium (Mobile)?Nova Labs controls Helium Mobile and has a fiduciary duty to its shareholders. HM revenues were temporarily burned in H2’2025, but the policy was recently reverted.⇒ It remains unclear how Nova Labs (equity) and HNT (tokens) will “split the pie”. Customers want RE-bundling, not UN-bundling.22%+ of Americans buy home + mobile internet in a bundle, up from ~10% in 2017. Customers want one integrated provider that keeps them connected everywhere.⇒ Helium Mobile’s CAC will rise as legacy providers increase lock-in via bundling.

Dawn: the Bull and Bear Case.Bandwidth
Thanks to cheap hardware, yields on wireless infra can reach 20%+.Programmable, software-defined radios are getting cheaper and more powerful every year, while users’ average monthly internet bills are roughly constant.⇒ Wireless yields can far exceed the 3-6% stablecoin farming yields available today.Dawn has a 5+ year track record of scaling a profitable ISP .Through Andrena, Dawn connects 20K+ homes to the Internet with industry-leading NPS and 70% gross margins. Efficient operation means higher yields for lenders.⇒ Dawn’s infrastructure is deployed and managed by experienced ISP operators.Every investor will be re-underwriting wireless economics in 2026.Starlink’s revenues have grown from $1B to $12B+ in the past three years, with parent company SpaceX targeting an IPO in 2026 at a rumoured $1.5T valuation.⇒ Seeing Starlink’s financials will drive growth investors back to wireless en masse. 
Competing frontier technology could render DAWN obsolete.Starlink, 6G, and other next-gen networks pose long-term competitive threats that could outperform DAWN’s fixed wireless architecture in coverage and speed.⇒ DAWN will need to adapt its infrastructure to future waves of telecom innovation.Entrenched ISP bundling strategies discourage user migration.Legacy internet providers are leveraging "triple-play" bundles (home internet, TV, and mobile) to increase switching costs and drive high customer retention.⇒ Bundling by incumbents increases CAC for single-product ISPs like Dawn. Regulatory hurdles around spectrum licensing threaten viability.While Dawn primarily operates in unlicensed bands today, future spectrum congestion or FCC licensing regulations could hinder coverage and unit economics.⇒ Home internet requires >30x more bandwidth than mobile, and gobs of spectrum.

DoubleZero: the Bull and Bear Case.Bandwidth
Extremely high technical and operational moat in fiber.Coordinating a fiber network with sub-millisecond latency requires massive capital expenditure, high-performance software, and specialized hardware expertise.⇒ It will be difficult for other DePINs to recreate Double Zero’s early moats.Strong adoption by Solana validators validates demand.Since its October launch, the network has onboarded 400+ validators representing 40%+ of all staked SOL (~$24B). ⇒ Growth in staking signals product-market fit for low-latency network underlays.Clear expansion path into non-crypto verticals like HFT.Double Zero’s architecture can create value for any latency-sensitive industry, including high-frequency trading (HFT), real-time gaming, and decentralized CDNs.⇒ Addresable markets beyond crypto reflects Double Zero’s long-term upside.
The right time to buy $2Z is two years from now, not today.Double Zero trades at a >100x multiple of run-rate revenues, like HNT in 2024. They already have 40% of Solana stake; the next growth driver will take time to develop.⇒ Double Zero’s next big successful use case is already baked into today’s price. Concentrated ownership and high inflation.At current prices, $15M of $2Z tokens will unlock for team, investors, and insitutional partners every month for the next four years (~8% of trading volume).⇒ If insiders decide to sell early, it will take massive buying pressure in $ to offset. Trading firms not named Jump will think twice before using 2Z.Jump Crypto helped develop and owns 28% of $2Z. For the current users, i.e. Solana validators, that isn’t a concern. For use cases like HFT, users may feel differently.⇒ Double Zero has to clear a high bar of credible neutrality for continued growth.

Grass: the Bull and Bear Case.
The strongest revenue growth in DePIN.Grass reported (offchain) revenue growth from $3M in Q2 to $13M in Q4. No other DePIN, to our knowledge, has added +$10M of quarterly revenues in a year, ever.⇒ Grass has room to grow: the leading web2 competitor, BrightData, is 5-10x bigger. Tokenholders are becoming first-class citizens.Grass critics cite a lack of transparency and tokenholder rights. In Q4, Grass burned $350K of tokens and explained their capital allocation and reinvestment strategy.⇒ Grass has a world-class business, and is rapidly becoming a world-class token. The best is yet to come: Live Context Retrieval (LCR) scales in 2026.Grass’s LCR engine allows agents/LLMs to query web data in real-time data. Today, only Grok has real-time awareness (via X). LCR powers this capability for any AI app. ⇒ If LCR is a success, Grass’s revenue growth will accelerate even faster than today. 
Unproven long-term demand for decentralized web and AI training.The market for decentralized web scraping and AI training data is still emerging, with unclear long-term demand from sticky enterprise customers.⇒ AI labs and model developers alone represent a large, but limited revenue pool. Weak differentiation in a commoditized data collection.Bandwidth access and web data collection are largely commoditized, with low technical barriers to entry and limited switching costs for buyers.⇒ Without sustained differentiation, Grass risks compressing margins with scale.Regulatory uncertainty around decentralized data collection.Large-scale, automated web data collection operates in a legally evolving gray area, particularly as AI regulation, data protection, and platform enforcement intensifies.⇒ Regulators, courts, or platforms could all limit Grass’s economics or scale.

Daylight Energy: the Bull and Bear Case.Energy
Energy infrastructure is incredible credit collateral.Energy bills are the last thing homeowners stop paying, driving <1% historical default rates on solar. Every home represents a $25K+ financing opportunity.⇒ Residential energy infrastructure can be lent against safely at massive scale. Daylight stacks every source of energy yield into a single wrapper.Daylight earns yield from 1) homeowners’ monthly energy bills, 2) selling energy back to the grid (VPP), 3) federal tax credits, and 4) renewable energy credits.⇒ Stacking multiple revenue streams drives energy yields from 8-10% to 15-20%. Daylight is live in MA + IL and launching in CA + CT + NJ imminently.Homeowners in these five states, >20% of the US population, will be eligible to get solar + batteries in their home with zero money down and save 30% on energy bills.⇒ Daylight is a no-brainer for homeowners; deployments likely top $100M+ in 2026. 
InfraFi is in its “v1” phase and may struggle to gain traction.InfraFi remains an experimental model with kinks to work out, and Daylight is using it to target energy infrastructure that’s already served by mature capital markets.⇒ For Daylight to scale, InfraFi must demonstrate superior value over TradFi.Density and scale is required to make VPPs viable.Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) require a high density of distributed energy resources (DERs) aggregated in a geographic area to provide meaningful value to the grid. ⇒ Slow regional scaling could weaken network economics and limit growth. Several layers of regulatory complexity and risk.Daylight’s model is tightly coupled to a wide variety of regulations including those around federal tax credits, utility and grid policies, and lending and tokenization.⇒ Daylight may need to pivot its model if regulations change in adverse ways.

17%+ of Fuse’s energy comes from renewables vs 0.2% for the broader grid.

Fuse Energy: the Bull and Bear case.Energy
Demand-side flexibility improves unit economics and margins.Fuse’s infrastructure enables demand-side load shifting, allowing them to both earn revenue and save on costs by move energy consumption away from peak hours. ⇒ Greater operational efficiency directly drives higher retail profit margins.VPP economics work at existing scale, and beyond.By aggregating flexible assets across its 250K+ household base, Fuse operates a VPP that monetizes grid services and mitigates exposure to volatile market spikes. ⇒ Fuse turns passive consumers into an active resource that reduces cost-to-serve.Vertical integration eliminates cold-start and coordination hurdles. As a fully licensed electricity supplier that owns the customer relationship, hardware, and trading, Fuse avoids the coordination friction typical of decentralized protocols. ⇒ Controling the energy stack enables rapid execution and a smooth user experience. 
The closed-loop-rewards model caps token value.The main value accrual for $ENERGY comes from users burning it for discounts on Fuse’s energy-related services and hardware. We have seen this movie before. ⇒ Nubank did this at scale in Brazil and token value topped at ~1% of equity value. The UK economy is large, but not likely not large enough.The UK energy market is roughly 25-30% the size of the US. However, note that Fuse plans to expand to Ireland in Q2’2026 and the US and Spain in H2’2026.⇒ At a $5B val (Fuse’s latest raise), further growth require success outside the UK. Fuse is betting big, and there will be bumps along the way.Scaling an OEM is capital-intensive and often drives volatility even in the success case. Tesla, for example, has had one >40% and one >70% drawdown since 2021⇒ The best returns are had when the market doubts a story—likely not at launch.

Glow Energy: the Bull and Bear Case.Energy
Accelerating demand for energy creates a massive TAM.Global electricity demand is surging by 3-4% per year. This "supercycle" in power consumption requires hundreds of gigawatts of new clean generation this decade.⇒ There are durable and growing tailwinds for Glow’s solar infrastructure.Proven supply-side execution suggests protocol scalability.Glow has already scaled to 100 solar farms and 42K solar panels, attracting $25M in deposits and eliminating 16K tons of CO2. Global solar subsidies are >$100B/yr.⇒ Glow’s supply side growth to date validates the scalability of its model.Best-in-class verification unlocks a premium on carbon credits.Glow uses a robust, multi-layered auditing system, combining IoT data, satellite imagery, and physical human inspections to solve the "trust gap" in carbon markets. ⇒ By ensuring additionality, Glow credits command a premium over legacy offsets..
Subsidies alone are not enough to sustain network economics.Glow has designed a hyper-efficient way of allocating subsidies to only marginally-unprofitable solar farms. In some cases, Glow serves strategic, non-subsidy goals.⇒ The bigger opportunity in energy is monetizing capacity, not allocating subsidies. Glow’s next big success will likely take years to play out.While Glow v1 focused on monetizing via carbon credits (to corporates), Glow v2 aims to directly recieve subsidies from communities, companies, governments.⇒ Attracting direct subsidies is a much longer sales cycle than carbon credits. Structural dampeners to token price appreciation.Glow’s ‘early liquidity’ contract sells 12M tokens (8M remaining) on a bonding curve, used to fund solar subsidies. This pool absorbs buy pressure from the market.⇒ A larger-than-usual amount of inflows are needed to drive $GLW price higher.

Geodnet is even launching its own drone in 2026.⇒ At current prices, crypto markets are giving no credit for Geodnet’s future growth. 
Unproven demand beyond legacy RTK services.The TAM of the existing market for RTK corrections (data only—not value added software) is <$10B, with relatively entrenched incumbents.⇒ Geodnet’s asymmetric upside relies on frontier use cases like robotics.Limited supply-side moat in terms of scale.GEODNET achieves near-global coverage with only ~20K nodes, representing roughly $15M in total deployer CapEx, which can be feasibly replicated.⇒ If Geodnet grows to >$50M ARR, new competitors will almost certainly appear. Long enterprise sales cycles slow revenue generation.B2B adoption often requires sales cycles of quarters or even years, which both creates execution risk and increases capital intensity. ⇒ Geodnet’s revenue growth may be too slow to attract growth investors.

Hivemapper: the Bull and Bear Case.Sensors
Hivemapper’s revenue stability proves some level of PMF.Hivemapper generated over $500K in revenue in both 2024 and 2025, with several multibillion dollar publicly-traded companies leveraging Hivemapper data.⇒ Hivemapper’s impressive roster of enterprise customers is unique in DePIN.Massive cost and structural advantages vs legacy mapping.Crowdsourcing imagery via low-cost "Bee" devices allows Hivemapper to collect data at a fraction of the cost of incumbents like Google Maps.⇒ Hivemapper’s cost-to-produce live data can be 100x cheaper than incumbents.Real-time data freshness creates a differentiated moat for AI.Hivemapper’s high-frequency, "ground-truth" imagery is significantly fresher than legacy maps, which often remain stale for years—critical for AV training and ADAS.⇒ AI road data collection expands Hivemapper’s TAM beyond just mapping.
Disconnect between customer logos and revenues.Hivemapper has announced five $10B+ companies (and many mid sized ones) as customers, and yet aggregate spend on map credits was only $1M at year-end. ⇒ Hivemapper users, even the very big ones, aren’t spending much on map credits. Launching the Bee miner failed to grow supply-side.Hivemapper launched the Bee, a higher-cost (2x) dashcam with integrated LTE and on-device compute. Despite the launch, # of map contributors was flat YoY at ~6K.⇒ Given flat mapper growth, it’s unlikely that many Bees were deployed in 2025. You couldn’t buy it even if you wanted to.Average daily trading volume in $HONEY is currently below $500K and aggregate DEX liquidity is also below $500K. Trading a $1M position could take a week or more.⇒ Investors need to account for (and discount) liquidity when trading DePIN tokens.

USDai: the Bull and Bear Case.Compute
GPU lending has low credit risk and relatively short duration.If a borrower defaults, datacenters can easily “reposses” (re-allocate) GPUs by renting the capacity to a different customer. Loans typically amortize over 3 years.⇒ USDai’s design mitigates the risks inherent in InfraFi: credit risk and duration. USDai pioneered InfraFi, and now has scale advantages.At $675M TVL, USDai represents 77% of M0’s TVL. USDai recently announced a deal for Paypal to incentivize (subsidize) yields on $1B of USDai’s TVL through PYUSD. ⇒ USDai’s scale allows it to tap into incentives that increase the yield on $sUSDai.InfraFi looping will become the Ethena-like trade of next cycle.USDai is approved as collateral on DeFi lending markets including Morpho, Pendle, Euler, Fluid, and Silo, enabling farmers to boost yields on USDai to mid/high teens.⇒ High levered (looped) yields will drive reflexively more demand for InfraFi assets.
GPU depreciation assumptions could compress yields for USDai.USDai’s loans typically amortize over 2-3 years. If GPU improvements over the next 2-3 years render prior models obsolete, USDai might not get repaid on its loans. ⇒ USDai’s yield relies on GPU utilization assumptions that might not hold up.Prior attempts at tokenized private credit RWAs have failed.Onchain real world private credit experiments have not worked out in the past, as far back as BTCJam (in 2017) to more recently Goldfinch (in 2023). ⇒ Historicaly, adverse selection has driven toxic flow and large defaults for RWAs.Regulatory hurdles could block out the US market entirely.Staking USDai for yield is currently limited to non-US or US accredited investors only. So long as this persists, USDai will be blocked out of US retail capital markets.⇒ Unclear regulatory overhang poses a significant risk to USDai’s capital scalability.

Moving off Cosmos = less sell pressure on $AKT. Today, Akash incurs the costs of economic security (via staking emissions) inherent in Cosmos. The upcoming L1 migration (expected 2026) massively reduces inflation.⇒ Moving to an established L1 structurally reduces inflation and sell pressure on AKT. Long history of transparency and decentralization.Since launching in 2020, Akash has been among the DePINs with the highest level of transparency between protocol developers, miners, and tokenholders.⇒ History has shown that the Akash community is uniquely aligned behind $AKT. 
Intense competition from hyperscalers and specialized neoclouds.Decentralized compute faces aggressive competition not only from hyperscalers (AWS, GCP, Azure) but also specialized neoclouds like CoreWeave and Lambda.⇒ Dominant centralized providers may relegate Akash to a niche, low-margin market.Limited revenue traction and low utilization rates.Despite a favorable macro backdrop for compute demand, Akash’s realized revenue remains modest and historical utilization rates are volatile (ranging from 20% to 80%).⇒ Miners will leave Akash if cost advantages fail to convert to high-volume demand.Rapid AI innovation cycles vs slow decentralized governance.AI model and hardware innovation moves much faster than governance. Centralized platforms can pivot and integrate new hardware or software optimizations instantly.⇒ Slow execution is causing Akash to fall behind centralized competitors.
