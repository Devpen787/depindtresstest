## Page 9

Preface   When  I  began  to  work  on  the  third  edition,  I  underestimated  the  extent  of  the  
undertaking.
 
What
 
I
 
initially
 
anticipated
 
as
 
a
 
few
 
months
 
of
 
work
 
evolved
 
into
 
a
 
three-year
 
project.
 
Shortly
 
after
 
starting,
 
I
 
realized
 
that
 
the
 
scope
 
and
 
depth
 
of
 
necessary
 
revisions
 
for
 
an
 
updated
 
third
 
edition
 
were
 
far
 
greater
 
than
 
initially
 
anticipated.
 
Consequently,
 
the
 
manuscript
 
expanded,
 
and
 
I
 
soon
 
found
 
myself
 
behind
 
schedule.
 
The
 
crypto
 
landscape
 
had
 
matured
 
rapidly,
 
and
 
there
 
were
 
so
 
many
 
more
 
topics
 
to
 
cover.
 
Eventually,
 
it
 
became
 
clear
 
that
 
my
 
task
 
had
 
evolved;
 
I
 
needed
 
not
 
only
 
to
 
broaden
 
the
 
scope
 
but
 
also
 
to
 
delve
 
deeper
 
into
 
the
 
subject
 
matter.
 
The
 
substantial
 
growth
 
of
 
the
 
book
 
led
 
me
 
to
 
initially
 
divide
 
the
 
third
 
edition
 
into
 
three
 
distinct
 
volumes:
 
“Money,
 
NFTs
 
&
 
DeFi,”
 
“DAOs
 
&
 
Purpose-Driven
 
Tokens,”
 
and
 
“Web3
 
Infrastructure.”
 
Following
 
the
 
publication
 
of
 
the
 
first
 
two
 
volumes—Money,
 
NFTs
 
&
 
DeFi
 
and
 
DAOs
 
&
 
Purpose-Driven
 
Tokens—I
 
observed
 
lower
 
sales,
 
which
 
I
 
attributed
 
to
 
the
 
strength
 
of
 
the
 
first
 
and
 
second
 
editions,
 
where
 
all
 
crypto
 
topics
 
were
 
comprehensively
 
covered
 
in
 
a
 
single
 
volume.
 
As
 
I
 
was
 
finalizing
 
the
 
Web3
 
Infrastructure
 
part,
 
I
 
decided
 
to
 
revert
 
to
 
my
 
original
 
strategy
 
of
 
combining
 
all
 
three
 
volumes
 
into
 
one.
 
 For  this  third  edition,  I  also  experimented  with  AI  tools.  While  their  utility  for  
research
 
proved
 
somewhat
 
mixed,
 
they
 
were
 
exceptionally
 
helpful
 
for
 
copy
 
editing.
 
I
 
also
 
used
 
AI
 
to
 
condense
 
the
 
text
 
of
 
the
 
already
 
published
 
volumes–Money,
 
NFTs
 
&
 
DeFi
 
and
 
DAOs
 
&
 
Purpose-Driven
 
Tokens–in
 
order
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
more
 
compact
 
third
 
edition
 
that
 
integrates
 
all
 
three
 
volumes
 
into
 
one
 
book.
 
These
 
tools
 
proved
 
particularly
 
effective
 
in
 
refining
 
my
 
sometimes
 
verbose
 
language,
 
enabling
 
me
 
to
 
compress
 
the
 
text
 
to
 
approximately
 
60
 
percent
 
of
 
its
 
original
 
length
 
without
 
sacrificing
 
depth
 
or
 
scope—though
 
the
 
process
 
was
 
not
 
without
 
its
 
complexities.
 
I
 
used
 
ChatGPT,
 
Claude
 
and
 
Gemini.
 
The
 
tools
 
were
 
very
 
effective
 
in
 
streamlining
 
certain
 
sections,
 
but
 
struggled
 
with
 
topics
 
that
 
required
 
more
 
nuance.
 
In
 
these
 
cases
 
I
 
reverted
 
back
 
to
 
my
 
original
 
writings.
 
Ultimately,
 
the
 
synergy
 
between
 
AI
 
tools
 
and
 
my
 
own
 
writing
 
and
 
editing
 
process
 
produced
 
superior
 
results
 
compared
 
to
 
what
 
either
 
could
 
have
 
achieved
 
independently.
 Regarding  the  structure  and  content  of  this  book,  the  first  part  primarily  explores  
the
 
technological
 
fundamentals
 
of
 
Web3
 
infrastructure.
 
While
 
this
 
book
 
is
 
intended
 
for
 
a
 
general
 
audience–many
 
of
 
whom
 
might
 
be
 
primarily
 
interested
 
in
 
application-level
 
use
 
cases–understanding
 
the
 
crypto-economic
 
fundamentals
 
of
 
Bitcoin,
 
Ethereum,
 
and
 
other
 
blockchain
 
networks
 
is
 
crucial
 
for
 
comprehending
 
blockchain
 
systems
 
and
 
their
 
game-changing
 
applications.
 
The
 
economic
 
dynamics
 
of
 
decentralized
 
networks
 
depend
 
on
 
value
 
capture
 
mechanisms
 
that
 
are
 
deeply
 
embedded
 
at
 
the
 
infrastructure
 
level,
 
influencing
 
incentives
 
and
 
governance
 
across
 
the
 
entire
 
ecosystem.
 
Without
 
understanding
 
how
 
Bitcoin
 
and
 
other
 
blockchain
 
networks
 
redefined
 
digital
 
ownership,
 
identity
 
management,
 
and
 
network
 
coordination,
 
it
 
becomes
 
challenging
 
to
 
make
 
sound
 
investment
 
decisions,
 
develop
 
effective
 
applications,
 
or
 
establish
 
appropriate
 
regulatory
 
frameworks.
 
 The  goal  of  the  first  part  is  to  strike  a  balance—being  specific  enough  to  convey  
the
 
core
 
crypto-economic
 
principles
 
while
 
avoiding
 
excessive
 
technical
 
detail.
 
It
 
also
 
introduces
 
key
 
building
 
blocks
 
of
 
different
 
blockchain
 
architectures,
 
explaining
 
how

design  choices  impact  security,  scalability,  decentralization,  governance  and  privacy  
across
 
blockchain
 
ecosystems.
 
Understanding
 
these
 
fundamentals
 
provides
 
a
 
necessary
 
foundation
 
for
 
later
 
discussions
 
on
 
how
 
tokenized
 
applications,
 
decentralized
 
finance,
 
digital
 
identity,
 
and
 
governance
 
models
 
operate
 
within
 
this
 
evolving
 
landscape.
 As  money  and  other  digital  assets  have  become  an  increasingly  native  feature  of  
the
 
Internet,
 
easily
 
programmable
 
with
 
just
 
a
 
few
 
lines
 
of
 
code,
 
the
 
second
 
part
 
of
 
this
 
book
 
is
 
a
 
cornerstone
 
for
 
understanding
 
the
 
scope
 
of
 
tokenization
 
and
 
its
 
impact
 
on
 
money,
 
finance
 
and
 
the
 
real
 
economy.
 
The
 
first
 
chapters
 
introduce
 
the
 
concept
 
of
 
tokenization,
 
its
 
various
 
use
 
cases,
 
and
 
explore
 
the
 
history
 
of
 
money
 
and
 
finance.
 
The
 
central
 
question:
 
Can
 
so-called
 
cryptocurrencies
 
and
 
other
 
tokenized
 
assets
 
replace
 
money
 
as
 
we
 
know
 
it?
 
In
 
public
 
debate,
 
these
 
questions
 
often
 
spark
 
highly
 
contentious
 
discussions,
 
with
 
arguments
 
frequently
 
shaped
 
by
 
one’s
 
personal
 
definition
 
of
 
money.
 
Debates
 
about
 
what
 
constitutes
 
"real"
 
money
 
can
 
sometimes
 
take
 
on
 
an
 
almost
 
religious
 
dimension,
 
where
 
opinions
 
are
 
rooted
 
in
 
ideology
 
or
 
partial
 
knowledge
 
rather
 
than
 
objective
 
analysis.
 A  significant  challenge  in  understanding  the  impact  of  Web3  and  tokenization  is  
the
 
prevalent
 
lack
 
of
 
financial
 
literacy,
 
a
 
subject
 
often
 
absent
 
from
 
curricula
 
in
 
most
 
schools
 
worldwide.
 
Many
 
students
 
graduate
 
from
 
high
 
school,
 
and
 
even
 
college,
 
with
 
little
 
to
 
no
 
understanding
 
of
 
what
 
money
 
is,
 
where
 
it
 
comes
 
from,
 
or
 
how
 
financial
 
markets
 
function.
 
When
 
I
 
studied
 
business
 
administration
 
at
 
the
 
Vienna
 
University
 
of
 
Economics,
 
I
 
graduated
 
in
 
1998
 
without
 
truly
 
understanding
 
what
 
money
 
is
 
or
 
how
 
it
 
is
 
created.
 
While
 
some
 
economics
 
courses
 
covered
 
aspects
 
of
 
money,
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
classifications
 
of
 
government-issued
 
money
 
(M1,
 
M2,
 
M3,
 
etc.),
 
I
 
was
 
completely
 
unaware
 
of
 
the
 
history
 
of
 
money,
 
the
 
different
 
types
 
of
 
monetary
 
systems,
 
or
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
modern
 
fiat
 
money
 
is
 
not
 
primarily
 
printed
 
or
 
coined
 
but
 
is
 
predominantly
 
created
 
by
 
private
 
banks
 
through
 
the
 
issuance
 
of
 
credit.
 
Conversations
 
with
 
international
 
colleagues
 
and
 
friends
 
who
 
also
 
graduated
 
from
 
business
 
and
 
economics
 
programs
 
at
 
universities
 
worldwide
 
suggest
 
that
 
their
 
experiences
 
were
 
similar.
 
The
 
financial
 
literacy
 
I
 
have
 
today
 
is
 
almost
 
entirely
 
the
 
result
 
of
 
personal
 
research
 
and
 
self-education
 
over
 
the
 
past
 
two
 
decades,
 
rather
 
than
 
what
 
I
 
studied
 
at
 
university
 
nearly
 
30
 
years
 
ago.
 
My
 
understanding
 
of
 
finance
 
expanded
 
exponentially
 
when
 
I
 
was
 
forced
 
to
 
grapple
 
with
 
Bitcoin,
 
Web3,
 
and
 
tokenization,
 
making
 
these
 
concepts
 
more
 
relevant
 
and
 
accessible
 
than
 
any
 
formal
 
education
 
I
 
had
 
received.
 This  knowledge  gap  in  money  and  finance  has  led  to  significant  information  
asymmetries,
 
hindering
 
individuals
 
to
 
make
 
informed
 
financial
 
decisions.
 
It
 
may
 
also
 
explain
 
why
 
retail
 
investors
 
with
 
limited
 
financial
 
experience
 
are
 
often
 
more
 
vulnerable
 
to
 
scams
 
and
 
fraudulent
 
schemes.
 
Unfortunately,
 
history
 
is
 
filled
 
with
 
examples
 
of
 
financial
 
deception,
 
and
 
the
 
crypto
 
industry
 
is
 
no
 
exception.
 
How
 
can
 
people
 
make
 
wise
 
investment
 
decisions
 
when
 
financial
 
literacy
 
remains
 
insufficient
 
or
 
even
 
non-existent—even
 
among
 
professionals
 
working
 
in
 
the
 
banking
 
sector?
 
While
 
I
 
strongly
 
believe
 
that
 
financial
 
regulation
 
plays
 
an
 
essential
 
role
 
in
 
consumer
 
protection,
 
I
 
also
 
believe
 
that
 
the
 
first
 
step
 
should
 
be
 
breaking
 
the
 
cycle
 
of
 
ignorance
 
by
 
introducing
 
financial
 
literacy,
 
which
 
is
 
why
 
I
 
dedicated
 
the
 
second
 
part
 
of
 
this
 
book
 
to
 
this
 
topic.
 The  final  section  focuses  on  DAOs  and  the  purpose-driven  tokens  that  steer  the  
actions
 
of
 
their
 
participants.
 
Beginning
 
with
 
Bitcoin,
 
this
 
section
 
critically
 
examines
 
the

pitfalls  and  potentials  of  decentralized  autonomous  and  semiautomated  coordination  
over
 
the
 
Internet.
 
I
 
explore
 
how
 
Proof-of-Work
 
introduced
 
a
 
novel
 
organizational
 
model
 
based
 
on
 
trust
 
by
 
math
 
rather
 
than
 
trust
 
by
 
legal
 
contract,
 
paving
 
the
 
way
 
for
 
a
 
range
 
of
 
decentralized
 
infrastructure
 
networks
 
that
 
emerged
 
over
 
the
 
years,
 
all
 
governed
 
by
 
one
 
or
 
several
 
purpose-driven
 
tokens
 
that
 
steer
 
collective
 
action.
 
The
 
first
 
two
 
chapters
 
outline
 
Web3-based
 
decentralized
 
organizations—their
 
origins
 
and
 
impact
 
from
 
perspectives
 
such
 
as
 
history,
 
cybernetics,
 
political
 
science,
 
economics,
 
and
 
complex
 
systems.
 
Since
 
there
 
is
 
no
 
one-size-fits-all
 
approach
 
to
 
designing
 
decentralized
 
organizations,
 
I
 
found
 
that
 
theory
 
alone
 
was
 
insufficient.
 
To
 
provide
 
a
 
more
 
tangible
 
understanding
 
of
 
best
 
practices
 
and
 
pitfalls,
 
I
 
selected
  
six
 
use
 
cases,
 
analyzing
 
them
 
through
 
a
 
design
 
thinking
 
framework
 
that
 
I
 
developed
 
specifically
 
for
 
this
 
book.
 
The
 
goal
 
was
 
to
 
help
 
uncover
 
common
 
interaction
 
patterns
 
and
 
illustrate
 
how
 
token
 
design
 
varies
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
purpose
 
and
 
governance
 
principles
 
of
 
an
 
online
 
community.
 
 Designing  incentive  tokens  that  align  individual  actions  with  a  collective  goal  
presents
 
an
 
optimization
 
challenge.
 
It
 
requires
 
a
 
balance
 
between
 
the
 
goals
 
and
 
constraints
 
of
 
various
 
stakeholders
 
while
 
ensuring
 
the
 
project's
 
long-term
 
sustainability.
 
A
 
P2P
 
payment
 
network
 
like
 
Bitcoin
 
has
 
vastly
 
different
 
requirements
 
than
 
a
 
P2P
 
data
 
exchange
 
(Ocean
 
Protocol),
 
a
 
P2P
 
telecom
 
network
 
(Helium),
 
or
 
a
 
P2P
 
stable
 
token
 
(MakerDAO).
 
Stakeholder
 
preferences,
 
governance
 
constraints,
 
and
 
market
 
mechanisms
 
must
 
be
 
tailored
 
accordingly.
 
The
 
analysis
 
of
 
these
 
use
 
cases
 
is,
 
therefore,
 
primarily
 
qualitative.
 
While
 
quantitative
 
analysis
 
is
 
valuable,
 
it
 
only
 
makes
 
sense
 
when
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
contextualized.
 
Metrics
 
like
 
market
 
cap
 
or
 
gross
 
network
 
value
 
mean
 
little
 
without
 
first
 
understanding
 
a
 
token’s
 
purpose,
 
industry
 
dynamics,
 
stakeholder
 
structures,
 
and
 
governance
 
models.
 
My
 
goal,
 
in
 
the
 
analysis
 
of
 
these
 
use
 
cases,
 
was
 
to
 
provide
 
the
 
conceptual
 
design
 
thinking
 
framework
 
that
 
is
 
necessary
 
to
 
evaluate
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
protocol
 
design
 
critically
 
rather
 
than
 
focus
 
on
 
raw
 
financial
 
metrics.
 In  analyzing  the  use  cases,  I  encountered  two  primary  challenges:  research  
limitations
 
and
 
scope
 
management.
 
Except
 
for
 
Bitcoin,
 
the
 
governance
 
structures
 
and
 
token
 
design
 
of
 
all
 
other
 
use
 
cases
 
that
 
I
 
analyzed
 
changed
 
frequently
 
and
 
significantly,
 
making
 
it
 
difficult
 
to
 
track
 
developments.
 
Moreover,
 
many
 
use
 
cases
 
lacked
 
proper
 
documentation,
 
or
 
were
 
chaotically
 
documented—an
 
ironic
 
reality
 
for
 
organizations
 
that
 
claim
 
public
 
accountability.
 
Additionally,
 
the
 
terminology
 
across
 
ecosystems
 
varied
 
greatly,
 
making
 
a
 
standardized
 
vocabulary
 
for
 
this
 
book
 
a
 
challenge.
 
Where
 
possible,
 
I
 
tried
 
to
 
harmonize
 
the
 
terminology
 
used
 
by
 
each
 
protocol,
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
book
 
more
 
readable.
 
The
 
second
 
challenge
 
was
 
maintaining
 
depth
 
of
 
analysis
 
without
 
excessive
 
detail,
 
as
 
each
 
use
 
case
 
could
 
have
 
warranted
 
an
 
entire
 
book
 
of
 
its
 
own,
 
yet
 
too
 
much
 
detail
 
risked
 
overwhelming
 
first-time
 
readers.
 
 As  for  my  personal  experience,  having  completed  this  third  edition  also  marks  the  
culmination
 
of
 
a
 
ten-year
 
journey,
 
which
 
began
 
with
 
the
 
BlockchainHub
 
in
 
Berlin
 
back
 
in
 
2015.
 
At
 
that
 
time,
 
the
 
community
 
was
 
smaller,
 
concepts
 
were
 
new,
 
and
 
everyone
 
was
 
trying
 
to
 
find
 
appropriate
 
words
 
for
 
this
 
novel
 
Internet
 
that
 
was
 
still
 
too
 
abstract
 
to
 
grasp.
 
Books
 
on
 
crypto
 
were
 
almost
 
nonexistent
 
and
 
meetups
 
served
 
as
 
the
 
primary
 
venue
 
to
 
learn
 
from
 
those
 
who
 
were
 
building
 
the
 
first
 
protocols.
 
When
 
I
 
started
 
to
 
write
 
the
 
first
 
edition
 
of
 
Token
 
Economy
 
in
 
2017,
 
the
 
crypto
 
landscape
 
was
 
just
 
beginning
 
to
 
take
 
shape.
 
It
 
was
 
a
 
time
 
before
 
DeFi
 
Summer,
 
before
 
the
 
NFT
 
craze,
 
before
 
the
 
surge
 
of
 
scalability
 
solutions,
 
before
 
CBDCs
 
and
 
before
 
governments
 
began
 
to
 
consider
 
Bitcoin
 
as

part  of  their  reserves.  It  was  also  before  presidents  started  to  rug  pull  their  constituents  
with
 
celebrity
 
coins
 
and
 
meme
 
coins.
 
The
 
vision
 
then
 
was
 
of
 
a
 
profoundly
 
self-sovereign
 
and
 
decentralized
 
web.
 
In
 
this
 
third
 
edition,
 
while
 
I
 
still
 
write
 
about
 
what
 
Web3
 
was
 
initially
 
conceived
 
to
 
be,
 
I
 
find
 
myself
 
observing
 
a
 
starkly
 
different
 
reality.
 
Many
 
services
 
that
 
were
 
meant
 
to
 
embody
 
decentralization
 
have,
 
in
 
practice,
 
become
 
recentralized.
 
Most
 
people
 
don't
 
control
 
their
 
tokens
 
because
 
they
 
don't
 
have
 
a
 
wallet.
 
Instead,
 
they
 
rely
 
on
 
custodial
 
services
 
of
 
centralized
 
exchanges.
 
Protocol
 
developers
 
are
 
faced
 
with
 
KYC
 
and
 
AML
 
regulations
 
that
 
could
 
censor
 
their
 
operations,
 
and
 
most
 
people
 
still
 
mistake
 
CeFi
 
services
 
for
 
DeFi.
 
It
 
seems
 
that
 
pragmatism
 
has,
 
in
 
some
 
ways,
 
replaced
 
idealism
 
in
 
this
 
evolving
 
crypto
 
landscape.
 
I
 
hope
 
this
 
book
 
strikes
 
a
 
balance
 
between
 
then
 
and
 
now,
 
idealism
 
versus
 
realism,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
depth
 
and
 
breadth–while
 
still
 
providing
 
valuable
 
insights
 
without
 
overwhelming
 
readers
 
who
 
are
 
new
 
to
 
the
 
world
 
of
 
crypto.
