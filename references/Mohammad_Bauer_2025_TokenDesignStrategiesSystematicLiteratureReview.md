Abstract 
 
This study identifies major approaches in token design for founders in the 
cryptocurrency/web3/blockchain space. The high failure rate of blockchain companies means 
that successful long-term performance will depend greatly on well-designed tokens. This 
study will integrate all prior research to highlight the most important aspects of structured 
tokenomics, including token utility, governance, and security. The study also contributes to 
the literature by introducing the Business Model Canvas (BMC) as a conceptual framework 
that enables the integration of best practices for token design, drawing on both academic and 
industry literature. The results indicate significant gaps in the literature. This study offers new 
and practical insights for founders to enhance stakeholders' engagement, improve regulatory 
compliance, and ensure project viability in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Furthermore, 
this research generates new knowledge that bridges the gap between the theory and practice 
of tokenomics, laying the groundwork for future research to develop and refine token design 
strategies. 
 
Keywords: Token design, business model, tokenomics, web3, cryptocurrency, ventures, 
entrepreneurship, blockchain-based organization.

     Introduction  
Web3 presents a similar high-risk environment to that of most new ventures — roughly 
50% of all businesses fail before reaching their third year of operation (U.S. Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, 2025). Moreover, because Web3 ventures have been founded in a relatively new 
digital space that utilizes blockchain technology to create trustless, secure, and decentralized 
ecosystems, the risk involved in establishing a successful venture in this space is significantly 
greater. As shown in the previous cryptocurrency market cycle, the mortality rate of Web3 
ventures has exceeded 80% (CoinMarketCap, 2025), as indicated by the dramatic decline in the 
number of top 1,000 crypto firms between 2019 and 2023. Despite these high-risk factors, Web3 
continues to attract entrepreneurs who see great opportunities and massive growth potential in 
the sector, valued at roughly $3 trillion by December 31, 2025 (CoinGecko, 2025). Blockchain 
technology is the driving force behind the rapid expansion of Web3 ventures and has enabled the 
creation of trustless, secure systems across multiple industries (Alkhudary et al., 2020; Attaran & 
Gunasekaran, 2019; Casino et al., 2019; Frizzo-Barker et al., 2020; Konstantinidis et al., 2018; 
Lo & Medda, 2020). 
The emergence of decentralized digital currency, as represented by Bitcoin (Nakamoto, 
2008), marked an innovation in utilizing blockchain technology to facilitate intermediary-free, 
secure, and transparent transactions. However, it was limited by constraints of scalability, cost, 
and transaction processing speed. Ethereum (Buterin, 2014) enabled many of the previously 
mentioned limitations with the development of programmable Smart Contracts, which enabled 
Decentralized Applications (DeFi), token-based ecosystems, and a variety of other uses. The 
innovations above represent the foundational components of Web3, which represent

decentralized, open, and permissionless infrastructure, allowing businesses to develop new 
business models while challenging the paradigm of centralization as defined in Web2 
(Konstantinidis et al., 2018; Frizzo-Barker et al., 2020). 
Tokens are the backbone of the Web3 ecosystem, as they represent ownership or access 
rights to digital assets and form the basis for numerous applications, including payment, 
governance, and supply chain management (Y. Chen, Richter, & Patel, 2020). Token design is a 
key determinant of success for entrepreneurial ventures, encompassing several key 
considerations, including token economics, utility, governance, and security (Schubert et al., 
2021). A well-designed token has the potential to align stakeholders' interests, promote 
participant involvement, and create a sustainable ecosystem. In contrast, poorly designed tokens 
may result in issues related to liquidity, market manipulation, and decreased community 
engagement (Y. Chen, Richter, & Patel, 2020). 
Although there is an increasing number of token-based ventures, the literature has 
identified significant voids in the structured approaches to token design — projects develop 
tokens without utilizing comprehensive frameworks for designing tokens that do not align with 
their respective business models and stakeholders' needs. Examples of poorly developed tokens 
can be seen in two recent cases: EigenLayer (an Ethereum re-staking project) and Arbitrum (an 
Ethereum Layer 2 scaling project), both of which raised questions about the utility of their tokens 
after launch. Both examples illustrate how speculative motivations frequently take precedence 
over the long-term value of a Web3 ecosystem, resulting in stakeholders losing confidence in the 
project's economic viability.

The Car Dossier case study illustrated how frameworks, such as the morphological box 
and decision trees, offer useful methodologies for assessing the necessity of a token and the 
degree to which it is aligned with the platform's business model (Oliveira et al., 2018). These 
frameworks enable decision-makers to determine whether a token is necessary and, if so, how to 
design it effectively to encourage user incentives and compliance with regulatory requirements. 
Nevertheless, the absence of a broader, structured framework for token design is a significant 
constraint, limiting stakeholder engagement and ultimately affecting the long-term sustainability 
of blockchain-based ventures (Attaran & Gunasekaran, 2019). 
This study employs an integrative literature review methodology, as described by Torraco 
(2016), to synthesize the fragmented body of research on blockchain token design. Torraco's 
framework highlighted the crucial role of integrative reviews in synthesizing disparate 
viewpoints to generate new knowledge. Integrative reviews are particularly suitable for emergent 
areas, such as Web3 token design, where the literature is still dispersed and not uniform. By 
systematically examining prior research, this study seeks to identify mechanisms through which 
token designs can be aligned with business models to maximize long-term commitment among 
stakeholders. 
To address the issue of unstructured token design, this review proposes the use of the 
Business Model Canvas (BMC) framework (Osterwalder & Pigneur, 2010), a commonly used 
tool for capturing and visualizing business models across various industries. Although the BMC 
has proven to be an effective means of developing systematic approaches to business modeling, 
its application in blockchain contexts requires adaptation to accommodate complexities such as 
token economics, governance, and regulatory concerns (Taherdoost & Madanchian, 2023). This

study will provide a structured basis for designing tokens that align with entrepreneurial 
objectives and foster sustainable Web3 ecosystems by incorporating blockchain-related concepts 
into the BMC. 
This integrative literature review synthesizes existing research on token design for 
blockchain-based ventures, filling a void in structured frameworks. This study introduces a 
conceptual framework — the Token Business Model Canvas (TBMC) — adapted from 
Osterwalder and Pigneur's (2010) Business Model Canvas core structure and concept — to help 
practitioners design tokens that align with their overall business strategy. This study contributes 
to enhancing our understanding of token design by integrating theoretical ideas with practical 
applications, thereby aiding in the development of sustainable Web3 ecosystems. 
In the following section, the paper outlines the theoretical background and situates token 
design within the broader literature on blockchain economics, entrepreneurship, and business 
model innovation. The methodology of our research is outlined in the next section, which 
includes a description of the literature review method, data sources, and classifications used to 
synthesize previous research into this paper. We then outline the significant results of the 
literature review, organizing the literature based on the major token design themes and mapping 
those themes to the 9 TBMC components. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of the 
findings from this research for both theory and practice, including important gaps, practical 
lessons learned, and possible avenues for further research. Lastly, we summarize the major 
contributions of this research and reflect on the study's limitations.

Background  
 
According to Chod and Lyandres (2021) and Chod et al. (2022), entrepreneurs face 
multiple challenges in designing thoughtful tokenomics, including understanding technological 
and regulatory nuances, balancing incentives, and ensuring scalability. Addressing these issues 
requires a multidisciplinary approach that combines technical knowledge, regulatory awareness, 
strategic market analysis, and user-centered design (Risius & Spohrer, 2017). They argue that 
entrepreneurs often fail to design tokenomics thoughtfully due to several interconnected factors. 
Their limited understanding of decentralized technologies, such as decentralized ledgers and 
applications (dApps), is a primary reason. This lack of comprehension can result in suboptimal 
token designs that fail to fully leverage the blockchain's capabilities, either in demand (from 
users) or in supply (from miners/validators), thereby restricting the project’s potential for 
innovation and its ability to introduce novel business models or disrupt existing ones. 
Another contributing factor is the underestimation of the innovation potential inherent in 
tokenomics. Tokenomics can revolutionize various sectors by enabling innovative financing, 
governance, and incentive mechanisms. However, many entrepreneurs fail to design their 
tokenomics effectively, thereby missing the opportunity to establish a competitive edge or attract 
significant investments and users. 
Additionally, neglecting user incentives and governance mechanisms undermines the 
effectiveness of tokenomics (Ballandies, 2022). Successful projects depend on balanced systems 
that encourage user participation and investment. Entrepreneurs may overlook this need, 
resulting in poor token distribution, insufficient stakeholder engagement, or governance models 
misaligned with the project’s long-term objectives.

Regulatory and compliance considerations also pose a critical challenge. Tokenomics 
must be designed with awareness of the varying regulatory landscapes across jurisdictions. US 
regulation is not as formalized or rigid as EU regulations; however, both have their own sets of 
regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrency, including commodities/securities, and real estate 
doctrine, as well as enforcement actions through the CFTC and SEC. The EU has established a 
unified regulatory framework under the MiCA Directive, providing a clear direction for 
regulating cryptocurrencies while offering investors enhanced protection, stronger anti-money 
laundering (AML) safeguards, and legal certainty for businesses (Bongini et al., 2025). However, 
the EU and US are both criticized for relying too heavily on securities law/public law 
perspectives in relation to cryptocurrency regulation, and not enough on the private-law 
infrastructure for tokenized rights and the innovations occurring in decentralized finance (DeFi), 
non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart-contract-based markets (Lee, 2024). Failing to address 
these issues can lead to legal challenges that hinder a project’s launch or scalability (Casino et 
al., 2019). 
Balancing short-term and long-term objectives is another area where entrepreneurs often 
struggle. Effective tokenomics requires providing short-term incentives to attract users while 
ensuring long-term sustainability. Many projects prioritize initial fundraising strategies, such as 
initial coin offerings (ICOs), without adequately considering long-term utility or value, or they 
fail to offer immediate benefits to early adopters (Gan et al., 2023). 
A lack of market analysis and user research further exacerbates design issues in 
tokenomics. Without a profound understanding of the target market and user needs,

entrepreneurs risk creating tokenomics that fail to resonate with their intended audience, 
resulting in low adoption rates (Freni et al., 2022). 
Complexity and poor user experience also deter adoption (Wandmacher, 2019). Overly 
complex tokenomics systems can confuse users and create cumbersome experiences, diminishing 
engagement and participation despite the underlying technological innovations. 
Finally, scalability and network effects are often overlooked in tokenomics design. 
Successful blockchain projects frequently rely on solid network effects, where the platform's 
value increases as more users join. Tokenomics that fail to incentivize user growth or make 
scaling difficult can limit a project’s overall success (Chod et al., 2022). 
The negative impact of not carefully designing tokenomics in crypto ventures may lead 
entrepreneurs to overlook or underutilize opportunities for innovation across diverse sectors 
through token design, resulting in projects that fail to meet market needs or differentiate 
themselves from competitors fully (Lamberty et al., 2020). This oversight can prevent the 
exploration and implementation of new business models facilitated by tokenomics, such as 
unique incentives or economic models within their ecosystems, leading to missed opportunities 
for value creation and project growth. Furthermore, entrepreneurs might not develop a 
comprehensive strategy that includes a clear vision of how the token will function within the 
ecosystem, its utility, and its value proposition to users and investors. The complexity of 
designing effective tokenomics, which balances supply and demand, ensures security, and 
complies with regulations, is often underestimated, resulting in flawed economic models that fail 
to sustain long-term project viability. Failing to design tokenomics that create compelling 
incentives for users and investors can lead to poor adoption and investment (Wandmacher,

2019). Finally, neglecting market dynamics and failing to incorporate feedback from the 
community and stakeholders can result in tokenomics misaligned with user needs or market 
realities. These insights suggest that successful tokenomics design requires a deep understanding 
of blockchain technology, innovative thinking, strategic planning, and responsiveness to market 
feedback. Entrepreneurs must address these areas to enhance the success chances of their crypto 
projects (Attaran & Gunasekaran, 2019). 
This literature review examines existing research on blockchain-based organization token 
design and identifies strategies for maximizing long-term stakeholder commitment. The method 
bridges theory and practice by illustrating how theoretical token design strategies have been 
applied in real-world projects and their resulting outcomes. This combined focus is important for 
academic researchers testing and refining theories, as well as practitioners seeking evidence-
based strategies to implement. An integrative literature review can utilize research from various 
fields, offering a multi-disciplinary perspective that enhances understanding of token design 
strategies and their impact on entrepreneurial success. 
The review aims to understand token design strategies that can enhance long-term 
stakeholder commitment, particularly within the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. Firstly, 
tokenomics provides the blueprint for creating and managing economic incentives within a 
blockchain project. Entrepreneurs must understand how to structure these incentives to ensure 
participant engagement from users, investors, and contributors (Zhang et al., 2019). Secondly, 
through tokenomics, entrepreneurs can design mechanisms that ensure the long-term 
sustainability of their projects by creating token distribution strategies that prevent market 
manipulation and guarantee viability beyond the initial hype.

Additionally, understanding tokenomics is crucial for compliance as the regulatory 
environment for cryptocurrencies and digital assets continues to evolve. Entrepreneurs must 
design their tokenomics with an awareness of legal frameworks to avoid future regulatory 
pitfalls, thereby ensuring the longevity of their project (Liu et al., 2022). Well-designed 
tokenomics can also make a project more attractive to investors by clearly outlining the token's 
value proposition, utility, and potential returns, increasing trust and investment from retail and 
institutional investors (Lamberty et al., 2020). Moreover, unique and innovative tokenomics can 
be a crucial differentiator for blockchain projects in a crowded market (Jürjens et al., 2022). It 
enables entrepreneurs to leverage tokenomics to offer innovative solutions to existing problems 
or create new markets, thereby setting their projects apart. Effective tokenomics can also 
incentivize users to join and stay on a platform, thereby enhancing the network effects that are 
crucial for the success of any platform-based business (Voshmgir & Zargham, 2019). 
Understanding and implementing tokenomics enables entrepreneurs to anticipate and manage 
economic risks associated with their projects, including issues such as token volatility, inflation, 
and other factors that impact financial stability (K. Chen et al., 2023). Tokenomics can also 
encompass governance mechanisms that enable decentralized decision-making, involving token 
holders in the project's development to ensure it evolves in a manner that benefits most 
stakeholders (Chod et al., 2022). Furthermore, by understanding tokenomics, entrepreneurs can 
optimize resource allocation within their ecosystem, determining how best to incentivize 
developers, users, and other key stakeholders to ensure efficient resource use (Han et al., 2022). 
Ultimately, a profound understanding of tokenomics can enable entrepreneurs to anticipate how 
the market will respond to decisions such as token burns, airdrops, or supply adjustments,

providing vital foresight for strategic planning and maintaining a competitive edge in a rapidly 
evolving industry (M. S. Kim & Chung, 2018). 
Tokenomics involves creating a sustainable, compliant, and competitive economic model 
that aligns stakeholder interests, rather than just designing tokens or conducting ICOs/IEOs. For 
entrepreneurs, mastering tokenomics is essential for the success and longevity of their ventures 
in the digital asset space (Freni et al., 2022). The study aims to identify key elements from 
academic research that entrepreneurs should consider when designing crypto project tokenomics 
and maximizing the chances of success. 
The evidence from the literature examined earlier suggests that token design can be 
viewed as an ongoing series of interconnected design trade-offs, rather than individual design 
choices. For example, entrepreneurs will have to make decisions concerning token design, 
balancing immediate rewards versus long-term sustainability, decentralization versus efficient 
decision-making regarding coordination, openness versus compliance with regulators, and speed 
of adoption versus economic and governance stability. The decision-making process regarding 
token supply, token utility, token governance, token security, and the funding mechanism for the 
token is ultimately dependent on multiple conflicting goals and objectives. As such, when 
decisions are made to improve one area or objective, there will likely be negative consequences 
or challenges in other areas. Token design viewed through a trade-off framework is a way of 
viewing and interpreting all design decisions across technical, economic, organizational, and 
regulatory environments, as well as providing a rationale for why tokenomics that are 
unstructured and/or based on speculation rarely lead to sustained ecosystem growth. In essence, 
this perspective emphasizes the need for structured models/frameworks that allow designers to

explicitly identify and manage design trade-offs, enabling them to develop more rational and 
sustainable token design strategies. 
 
Conceptual Framework  
Zott et al. (2011) research shows that there is no single agreed-upon definition of a 
business model. Osterwalder and Pigneur (2010) define a business model as: 
 A conceptual tool that contains a set of elements and their relationships and allows 
expressing the business logic of a specified firm, a description of the value [a] company 
offers to one or several segments of customers and of the architecture of the firm and its 
network of partners for creating, marketing, and delivering this value and relationship 
capital, to generate profitable and sustainable revenue streams. (p. 17) 
Other academic researchers have used the versatile nature of the BMC as a conceptual 
framework in services (Ojasalo & Ojasalo, 2018), in technology fields like 3D printing (Rayna & 
Striukova, 2016), life science innovations (Zott et al., 2011), cloud technology (DaSilva et al., 
2013), and to demonstrate blockchain technologies' value potential (Heim, 2020; Nowiński & 
Kozma, 2017). The model offers a structured, visual framework for developing new or 
documenting existing business models (Osterwalder & Pigneur, 2010). It breaks down a business 
model into nine key components: value propositions, customer segments, channels, customer 
relationships, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, key partnerships, and cost structure.  
  Osterwalder and Pigneur (2010) define value proposition as a company's unique 
products or services to solve customer problems or satisfy needs. It encapsulates the distinctive 
value distinguishing the business from competitors, such as innovation, customization, or cost-

efficiency. Secondly, customer segments represent the different groups of individuals or 
organizations a business serves. These groups are identified based on shared characteristics, such 
as demographics, behavior, or needs. Tailoring the value proposition to specific customer 
segments is crucial for achieving customer satisfaction and driving business success. Then, 
channels describe how a company delivers its value proposition to customers. These can include 
physical stores, online platforms, or intermediaries. Effective channels ensure that products and 
services are accessible to customers while optimizing communication and distribution. 
Additionally, customer relationships refer to the interactions a business maintains with its 
customers. These relationships can range from personal assistance to automated services, 
fostering customer loyalty and satisfaction. Revenue streams also represent the income generated 
from each customer segment. This element encompasses the various ways a business can 
generate revenue, including direct sales, subscription fees, licensing, and advertising. Identifying 
and optimizing revenue streams is critical for financial sustainability. 
Moreover, key resources are essential for delivering the value proposition, reaching target 
customer segments, and sustaining business operations (Osterwalder & Pigneur, 2010). These 
resources may include physical, intellectual, human, or financial assets. Another element is key 
activities, a company's primary tasks or operations to create and deliver its value proposition 
(Osterwalder & Pigneur, 2010). Depending on the business model, these activities often include 
production, problem-solving, networking, or customer engagement. The authors define key 
partnerships that involve collaborations with external entities essential for the business model's 
success. These partnerships can include suppliers, distributors, or strategic alliances, which help 
optimize operations, reduce risks, or access additional resources. The authors then proceed to

outline, finally, the cost structure, which details all the expenses incurred to operate the business 
model. The latter includes fixed and variable costs, economies of scale, and cost optimization 
strategies. They argue that understanding the cost structure is vital for managing expenses and 
ensuring profitability. 
The Osterwalder and Pigneur (2010) business model canvas framework, with its core 
structure and concept, could be highly beneficial for designing tokenomics within blockchain 
projects by focusing on value creation, stakeholder needs, and sustainable business practices 
(Nowiński & Kozma, 2017). Entrepreneurs can develop tokenomics models that support the 
long-term success of their blockchain projects. The structured yet flexible and iterative approach 
of the BMC, advocated by Blank (2013) for startup development, makes it a suitable tool in the 
complex, dynamic, and experimental nature of blockchain and cryptocurrency ventures (Heim, 
2020). Integrating these components thoughtfully into the design and implementation of 
blockchain projects or tokenomics strategies can significantly enhance their chances of success 
by ensuring they align with the desires of their market segment, remain operationally and 
financially viable, and effectively leverage the unique capabilities of blockchain technology, as 
shown in Figure 1.

Research Method and Design  
According to Torraco (2016), the interrogative literature review method is particularly 
suitable for our study for several reasons. First, the integrative literature review is designed to 
create new knowledge by synthesizing existing literature to offer fresh frameworks and 
perspectives, aligning perfectly with our goal of proposing insights into tokenomics and best 
practices. Second, this method is ideal for dynamic topics, such as tokenomics, which have 
rapidly growing bodies of literature but often lack comprehensive reviews. This reflects the issue 
the study addresses, where entrepreneurs might not fully leverage the potential of crypto

projects. Third, the review method involves critically analyzing, reviewing, and synthesizing the 
literature, which helps resolve inconsistencies and provides new viewpoints, directly supporting 
our purpose of offering entrepreneurs valuable insights and best practices from academic 
literature.  
Additionally, the method bridges the gap between theory and practice by demonstrating 
how theoretical token design strategies have been applied in real-world projects and their 
outcomes. This dual focus is crucial for both academic researchers seeking to test and refine 
theories and practitioners looking for evidence-based strategies to implement. Finally, token 
design and crypto projects lie at the intersection of finance, economics, technology, law, and 
business. An integrative literature review can draw on research from these diverse fields, 
providing a multi-disciplinary perspective that enriches the understanding of token design 
strategies and their implications for entrepreneurial success. The article search is described in 
Figure 2.

BIDA across BMC elements is also highly represented, emphasizing the necessity of a 
solid understanding of blockchain and cryptocurrency fundamentals for entrepreneurs in this 
space. 
Token financing innovation (TFI) has the lowest representation, suggesting that while the 
impact of tokenomics and cryptocurrencies is recognized, it may be a more niche or emerging 
area of focus in the literature. 
It is worth noting that BMC elements do not cover GTA in customer relationships, 
channels, customer segments, cost, and revenue, indicating a less emphasized focus from 
researchers in past years. 
 
Findings  
Tokenomics as a New Discipline for Business Modeling Innovation 
Tokenomics, the study of the economics of cryptocurrencies and tokens (Oliveira et al., 
2018), draws heavily from the precedents set by Bitcoin and Ethereum. It encompasses the 
incentives, distribution mechanisms, supply dynamics, and utility functions that govern token 
ecosystems. As we delve into the complexities of tokenomics, understanding the foundational 
principles and limitations of Bitcoin, as well as the expansive possibilities introduced by 
Ethereum, is crucial. This exploration offers insights into the evolution of digital assets and the 
potential for innovative economic models that challenge traditional notions of value, governance, 
and organizational structures. 
The advancement of blockchain and DLT has introduced a fundamental shift in global 
business models (Y. Chen, Richter, & Patel, 2020). This progression from product-centric to 

---

## Page 30

 
 
 
 
28 
platform-based and ultimately to protocol-oriented frameworks underscores a strategic 
transformation in how value is created, exchanged, and distributed. In this new paradigm, the 
emphasis shifts towards designing underlying protocols on which platforms and products are 
built. This shift is significantly powered by the concept of tokenomics, which lies at the heart of 
many Web3 projects. Tokenomics, a combination of tokens and economics, refers to the design 
and implementation of economic models for blockchain-based ecosystems (Jürjens et al., 2022). 
These models dictate tokens' distribution, ownership, and value exchange mechanisms within 
these ecosystems, influencing user behavior and ensuring network security and sustainability 
(Voshmgir & Zargham, 2019). 
Tokenomics is fundamental to the success of Web3 projects, serving as a critical factor in 
their design, launch, and long-term viability (Van de Vyver, 2023). Through carefully crafted 
token models, projects can incentivize participation, align stakeholders' interests, and create 
robust, decentralized economies (Pietrewicz, 2019). Tokens can serve various functions 
(Lamberty et al., 2020), including but not limited to governance, where token holders vote on 
critical decisions; utility, where tokens grant access to services or resources within the 
ecosystem; and rewards, where contributors to the network are compensated. This multifaceted 
role of tokens enables a more equitable distribution of value among users, developers, and 
investors, fostering a sense of ownership and community engagement that is often absent in 
traditional business models. The introduction of tokenomics has thus opened new avenues for 
funding, community building, and value creation, emphasizing the shift towards decentralized, 
protocol-driven innovation. As the Web3 space continues to mature, the development and 
refinement of tokenomics models will remain crucial in unlocking the full potential of

blockchain and DLT, paving the way for more transparent, inclusive, and efficient digital 
economies. 
Tokenomics, as a burgeoning discipline, is becoming essential for entrepreneurs to 
understand and integrate into the design or update existing business models. This integration is 
not merely an addition but a transformative approach that necessitates a comprehensive 
understanding of decentralized networks and economies (Freni et al., 2022). As we delve deeper 
into the components and innovative parameters of tokenomics, this discipline introduces novel 
considerations that significantly impact the structure and strategy of business models in the 
digital and decentralized era. 
The BMC , a strategic management template for developing new or documenting existing 
business models introduced by Osterwalder and Pigneur (2010), is an excellent framework for 
illustrating the incorporation of tokenomics. The BMC comprises nine critical elements- key 
partners, key activities, key resources, value propositions, customer relationships, channels, 
customer segments, cost structure, and revenue streams—and offers a holistic view of a 
business's operational and strategic considerations. Each element can be re-envisioned when 
applied to tokenomics to highlight the unique aspects and opportunities presented by blockchain 
and DLT technologies, as illustrated in Table 3 (see appendix). 
Incorporating tokenomics into the BMC necessitates rethinking traditional business 
strategies to embrace Web3's decentralized, inclusive, and transparent ethos. As we discuss the 
additional and novel parameters of tokenomics to consider in a business model, it will become 
evident how this discipline reshapes the foundation of the business model design, offering 
unprecedented opportunities for value creation and capture.

The sub-categories will discuss the findings in relation to the nine business model canvas 
elements. 
Value propositions. 
Different token types and categories.  
Blockchain tokens can be broadly categorized based on their functionality, underlying 
value, and intended use within the ecosystem. Three types of tokens are cryptocurrency, utility, 
and security tokens (Schwiderowski et al., 2023). Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, serve as 
digital currencies without a central issuing authority. Utility tokens provide access to a 
blockchain-based product or service, facilitating ecosystem interactions without necessarily 
representing ownership or equity. Security tokens represent investment contracts, where the 
investment in the token results in an expectation of profit from the efforts of others, making them 
subject to regulatory scrutiny (Jürjens et al., 2022; Kaal, 2018). 
Different types of token utilities. 
The utility of tokens varies significantly across blockchain ecosystems, influencing user 
participation and ecosystem health. Utility tokens have been emphasized to enable platform 
functionalities such as participation in governance, access to services, or entitlement to future 
profits. The utility often aligns with the platform's goal, whether by incentivizing specific 
actions, such as network security (via staking), or facilitating the use of dApps. Moreover, 
tokenomics incorporates the strategic design of tokens to enhance network effects, encourage 
desired behaviors, and ensure the long-term viability and growth of the platform (Jürjens et al., 
2022). 
Principles for designing sound blockchain governance. 

---

## Page 33

 
 
 
 
31 
Sound blockchain governance entails mechanisms that ensure the fair, transparent, and 
effective management of the blockchain ecosystem. The governance framework should include 
clear rules for decision-making, dispute resolution, and updates to the protocol. Moreover, it 
should allow adaptability to technological advances and changing stakeholder needs. Effective 
governance models often incorporate token-based mechanisms, where token holders can 
participate in governance decisions directly or through delegated representatives, thus aligning 
incentives between the platform and its users (Zhang et al., 2019). A comprehensive governance 
framework addresses both on-chain and off-chain governance structures, ensuring that 
technological and organizational aspects are covered (Kaal, 2018). 
Token design considerations and functions. 
The foundation of a thriving token economy lies in meticulous token design, which 
requires, on the one hand, addressing several critical considerations (Schubert et al., 2021) and, 
on the other hand, ensuring the token's functionality within the ecosystem, which is paramount 
(Khaqqi et al., 2018; Schubert et al., 2021). Refer to Table 5 in the appendix, which outlines 
token design considerations and functions. 
The proposed tokenomics design approach integrates comprehensive considerations and 
functions to guide the creation of balanced and sustainable token economies. This approach aims 
to facilitate the development of equitable, efficient blockchain ecosystems that comply with 
regulatory standards by addressing critical design aspects and embedding essential token 
functions. 
Token incentives are designed to increase the value of a token. 

---

## Page 34

 
 
 
 
32 
Efficient token incentive designs, acknowledging the factors affecting token economics, 
and navigating the inherent challenges are essential for the flourishing and sustainability of token 
ecosystems. By carefully considering user adoption, expected future utility, token riskiness, and 
the scalability-decentralization balance while addressing the intricacies of integrating multiple 
tokens, diminishing impacts, ethical dimensions, volatility, and scalability-security issues, token 
ecosystems can achieve and maintain long-term value (Khaqqi et al., 2018; Tan, 2019; 
Wandmacher, 2019). The main factors that enhance token value and its inhibitors are represented 
in Table 6 in the appendix. 
The case of dual token-design tokenomics. 
The article by Dimitri (2023) explores the economic foundations of dual-token 
blockchain platforms, explaining how these systems determine the monetary value and market 
desirability of their constituent tokens. Dual-token systems introduce a nuanced architecture 
within blockchain ecosystems, separating governance tokens from those used for transactional 
purposes. This segregation clarifies the utility and role of each token type, aiming to decouple 
transaction fees from market volatility and foster a more stable economic environment for 
platform operations. The author's central insights and contributions are multifaceted. Firstly, 
market prices of tokens serve as pivotal indicators of their desirability, reflecting the 
community's valuation of the tokens' utility and potential for future rewards. The dual-token 
model enhances this understanding by allowing distinct market reflections for governance versus 
operational utility, providing nuanced insights into platform engagement levels and user 
priorities. Secondly, the study introduces individual indicators for prices and quantities, positing 
that while prices offer a snapshot of current value, traded quantities provide insights into the 

---

## Page 35

 
 
 
 
33 
tokens' circulation and demand dynamics. This dual perspective enriches the evaluation by 
capturing both immediate market reactions and longer-term trends in token utility and adoption. 
Combining price and quantity indicators yields a holistic view of token desirability and 
economic success. This approach aligns with the multifunctional roles of tokens within 
ecosystems, while addressing their speculative value and functional use in governance or 
transaction facilitation. The insights from evaluating dual-token systems have significant policy 
implications, guiding platform decision-making regarding token supply management, service 
quality enhancement, and fee structuring. These indicators can serve as instrumental tools for 
strategic planning and operational adjustments within blockchain platforms.  
The dual-token model's inherent flexibility also supports tailored incentive mechanisms 
and economic structures, enabling platforms to adjust their strategies in response to evolving user 
behavior and market conditions. This adaptability is crucial for sustaining platform growth and 
user engagement over time (Dimitri, 2023). 
In integrating insights from Dimitri (2023), Schubert et al. (2021), Khaqqi et al. (2018), 
and Tan (2019), it becomes evident that the dual token model not only offers a nuanced approach 
to blockchain economics but also addresses inherent challenges such as volatility and token 
dilution. 
The dual token model delineates token functions, enhancing platform stability by 
segregating governance from operational activities (Dimitri, 2023; Schubert et al., 2021). This 
separation allows for a more targeted approach to incentivization and token utility, aligning 
token distribution and use with specific ecosystem needs (Dimitri, 2023).  

---

## Page 36

 
 
 
 
34 
Furthermore, the model offers a dynamic framework for understanding and managing the 
economic implications of token issuance and market behavior, thus mitigating risks associated 
with token volatility and dilution (Khaqqi et al., 2018; Tan, 2019). The inclusion of numerical 
indicators based on market prices and traded quantities, as discussed by Dimitri (2023), 
complements this framework by providing a tangible method for evaluating token desirability 
and economic value. These indicators reflect immediate market valuations and capture broader 
trends in token circulation and demand, offering insights into both speculative value and 
practical utility within the blockchain ecosystem.  
Moreover, the dual token model’s inherent flexibility supports the customization of 
economic structures and incentive mechanisms, which is crucial for adapting to evolving user 
behaviors and market conditions. This adaptability is essential for sustaining platform growth, 
user engagement, and long-term ecosystem viability. 
The case of play-to-earn (PTE) and play-to-X (PTX) tokenomics. 
The emergence of play-to-earn (PTE) games represents a significant evolution in the 
gaming industry, combining the allure of gaming with the financial incentives offered by 
cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Through an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) 
analysis, Lee and Park (2023) examine the factors that motivate players to participate in PTE 
games. This analysis revealed three primary motivating factors. Firstly, the gaming experience 
emerged as the most critical factor, emphasizing the intrinsic value of fun and engagement in 
PTE games. Players prioritize the enjoyment derived from gameplay, indicating that the appeal 
of PTE games extends beyond mere financial incentives. Elements such as game quality, genre, 
and level of challenge significantly contribute to player satisfaction and retention. Then, the 

---

## Page 37

 
 
 
 
35 
economic outcomes are essential for players. This factor encompasses the potential for earning 
through gameplay, including tokenomics, return on investment (ROI), the reliability of the game 
company, and the fluctuating price of in-game currencies. The analysis suggests that while 
financial incentives are a strong motivator, they are secondary to the core gaming experience. 
PTE game awareness ranks as the third motivating factor. This encompasses the players' 
awareness and understanding of the game's mechanics, entry timing, platform, and the 
community surrounding the game. Knowledge and timely participation in PTE games can 
significantly affect players' experiences and potential financial gains. 
The findings from the AHP analysis illuminate the intricate balance between 
entertainment and economic incentives in PTE games. While financial outcomes and game 
awareness undeniably influence player engagement, the gaming experience remains the 
fundamental driver. In the PTE model, fun is paramount; merely having a token or the prospect 
of earning is insufficient to sustain player interest. Successful PTE games, such as CryptoKitties, 
Axie Infinity, and Decentraland, have thrived by integrating compelling gameplay with the 
financial benefits of blockchain technology (Lee & Park, 2023). As the PTE and generally PTX 
sector evolves, developers must continue to innovate, ensuring that games and dApps with 
gamification, such as StepN, remain engaging and enjoyable to sustain and expand their player 
base. 
NFT and Business Model Innovation. 
NFTs represent a transformative development in the digital landscape, fundamentally 
redefining the concept of ownership and driving the evolution of innovative business models. As 
Li and Chen (2023) outlined, NFTs are unique, blockchain-based digital assets that provide a 

---

## Page 38

 
 
 
 
36 
transparent, secure, and transferable ownership mechanism over digital goods. The author argues 
that NFTs have facilitated the emergence of novel value creation and exchange paradigms across 
various sectors. Initially, NFTs enabled the establishment of unambiguous, secure, and 
transferable digital property rights. NFTs address a longstanding challenge in digital commerce: 
the lack of clear ownership of digital goods. This paradigm shift enables a vibrant market for 
digital assets, where creators and consumers can freely create, own, exchange, and monetize 
digital content. The sale of Beeple's digital art piece, "Everyday: The First 5000 Days," sold for 
$69 million at Christie's, exemplifying the monumental impact of NFTs in recognizing and 
valuing digital creativity (Li & Chen, 2023). NFTs have enabled the creation of new business 
models that prioritize decentralization, user empowerment, and community engagement. These 
models leverage the unique characteristics of NFTs, including digital ownership and asset 
composability, to foster decentralized communities and democratize content creation and 
distribution. 
A notable instance is the CryptoPunks project by Larva Labs, or more recently, Pudgy 
Penguins. They have achieved significant commercial success and cultivated a robust community 
around their collectibles, demonstrating the potent combination of NFTs and community-driven 
value creation. Additionally, NFTs enable the integration of digital attributes with physical 
products, providing enriched consumer experiences and opening new avenues for engagement 
and value creation. This innovative approach enables product differentiation and the introduction 
of unique digital experiences without incurring additional production costs. For example, Nike's 
acquisition of RTFKT and the subsequent launch of CryptoKicks digital sneakers highlight how 

---

## Page 39

 
 
 
 
37 
NFTs can enhance physical products with digital features, opening new markets and engagement 
strategies. 
Finally, NFTs enable direct-to-consumer interaction and community building. Through 
digital wallets and blockchain technology, NFTs enable direct engagement between creators, 
brands, and consumers, strengthening relationships and fostering community involvement. This 
direct interaction supports the creation and co-creation of shared value, allowing communities to 
actively influence and participate in the evolution of brands and products. The Starbucks 
Odyssey program, which utilizes NFTs to reward and engage customers in unique experiences, 
exemplifies how NFTs can build and nurture loyal customer communities. NFTs present vast 
opportunities for business model innovation, underpinned by new forms of digital ownership and 
enhanced community engagement. However, leveraging these opportunities demands 
overcoming challenges such as sustaining active communities, navigating uncertain legal 
landscapes, and addressing technical limitations. For companies to fully capitalize on the 
potential of NFTs, adapting to the decentralized ethos of Web3 — characterized by 
empowerment, transparency, and collective participation — is crucial. Highlighted by the 
success stories of CryptoKitties, Pudgy Penguins, Axie Infinity, and Decentraland, NFTs 
demonstrate the significant potential to cultivate dynamic, decentralized communities and 
redefine digital content and commerce. 
Token interoperability matters. 
Kaal's (2018) article offers a comprehensive analysis of the token model landscape within 
the cryptocurrency market, highlighting the growing trend toward interoperability among digital 
tokens. He demonstrates that 60 of the 100 tokens analyzed either currently allow or intend to 

---

## Page 40

 
 
 
 
38 
facilitate intersystem functionality, suggesting a strong inclination towards interoperable designs 
in the competitive token market. This trend is driven by the desire to attract a broader user base 
and enhance the utility and applicability of tokens across various systems and platforms. 
Conversely, 32 out of the 100 tokens are designed to be restricted to specific ecosystems, 
so a decision was made to preserve their unique value propositions within their native 
environments. This design choice highlights the diversity of strategic approaches within the 
token market, striking a balance between exclusivity and widespread applicability. 
The findings from Kaal's (2018) research underscore the significant influence of 
interoperability on token design within the competitive cryptocurrency market. The inclination 
towards interoperable tokens reflects a strategic effort to enhance the utility and market appeal of 
tokens. However, the study also highlights the complex challenges of this trend, including the 
need to maintain an engaged community, navigate uncertain legal frameworks, and address 
technical limitations such as fractionalization. As the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry 
continues to evolve, companies and projects must adapt to and embrace the decentralized ethos 
of Web3, leveraging the opportunities presented by interoperability to foster innovation and 
growth. 
Key activities. 
Securing the blockchain through tokenomics. 
The integration of tokenomics into blockchain technology has ushered in a new era of 
digital economics, emphasizing the necessity for robust security measures. As highlighted in 
recent studies (Kampakis, 2018; Nasrulin et al., 2022), securing the blockchain infrastructure is 

---

## Page 41

 
 
 
 
39 
crucial for maintaining the integrity, privacy, and overall functionality of these decentralized 
networks. 
Importance of securing the blockchain. 
Securing the blockchain is critical for maintaining its functionality and reliability 
(Kampakis, 2018). Robust security measures ensure the integrity of transactions by preventing 
unauthorized modifications that could result in fraudulent activities. Additionally, safeguarding 
privacy is essential, as it protects sensitive information from malicious actors who might exploit 
vulnerabilities. Furthermore, effective security fosters trust among users, a foundational element 
for the widespread adoption of blockchain technology and its diverse applications. By addressing 
these security imperatives, blockchain systems can sustain their promise of decentralization, 
transparency, and reliability in various domains. 
How tokenomics addresses blockchain security, privacy, and integrity. 
Tokenomics enhances the security, privacy, and integrity of blockchain systems (Nasrulin 
et al., 2022). Through the design of token-based incentive mechanisms, blockchain networks 
encourage behaviors that contribute positively to the ecosystem's health. For instance, proof-of-
stake (PoS) consensus algorithms reward participants for validating transactions and securing the 
network against fraudulent activities. Additionally, tokenomics can incorporate privacy-
enhancing features, such as zero-knowledge proofs (i.e., zk-proof), to conduct transactions 
without revealing sensitive information, thus maintaining users' privacy and the system's 
integrity. For illustration, it is like someone buying bread at the bakery and leaving their banking 
statement to the baker. Examples like DeepChain, which utilizes zero-knowledge proofs for 
privacy-preserving computations in AI and deep learning contexts, showcase the innovative 

---

## Page 42

 
 
 
 
40 
applications of tokenomics in enhancing blockchain functionalities (Weng et al., 2019). 
However, despite these advancements, issues such as effective community engagement, legal 
uncertainties, and the potential for centralization within token-based governance models persist, 
underscoring the need for continued innovation and regulatory evolution. 
Main measures to secure the blockchain. 
Researchers have identified measures to increase and inhibit blockchain security, as 
summarized in Table 7 in the appendix. Tokenomics and the design of token incentives are 
integral to addressing the challenges of blockchain security, privacy, and integrity. Innovations 
like BasedAI and VeniceAI, which integrate AI and run large language models (LLMs) on 
blockchain through mechanisms such as zero-knowledge proofs (zk-proof), showcase the 
potential for advanced security solutions and AI privacy.  
Governing the blockchain through tokenomics. 
The integration of tokenomics into blockchain governance frameworks is pivotal in 
addressing the complex challenges of decentralized systems (Han et al., 2022). Governance in 
the blockchain is fundamental for several reasons (Yue Liu et al., 2022). It ensures that the 
system operates efficiently and that decisions are in the best interests of all stakeholders. 
Effective governance mechanisms help maintain the blockchain's integrity, transparency, and 
trustworthiness, which is crucial for its adoption and functionality. 
How tokenomics addresses firm governance limits. 
Tokenomics provides a novel approach to address the limitations of traditional firm 
governance by incentivizing behaviors that align with the long-term health and sustainability of 
the ecosystem. By embedding economic incentives into the token design, such as staking or 

---

## Page 43

 
 
 
 
41 
voting rights, tokenomics aligns the interests of diverse stakeholders, promoting cooperative 
behavior and mitigating conflicts typically seen in corporate governance structures (Gan et al., 
2023). 
Table 8 presents the main measures observed to govern a token-based blockchain 
project (see appendix). Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) enable decision-
making through smart contracts and community votes, removing central authority and aligning 
with the blockchain’s ethos (Beck et al., 2018). However, voter apathy and dominance by major 
token holders can undermine equitable governance. For example, the Uniswap (a major DeFi 
dApp on Ethereum) governance vote controversy highlighted the challenges of decentralized 
decision-making when venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) used its token holdings 
to influence a proposal. Critics argued that this showcased centralization risks and opaque power 
dynamics in supposedly decentralized governance systems, undermining trust in fair and 
equitable decision-making processes (Kessler, 2023). 
Token staking and voting empower participants to influence a project's direction by 
staking tokens, enhancing network security and community engagement (Cong et al., 2020); 
however, skewed token distribution risks centralization, granting large holders disproportionate 
control. 
Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) enhances scalability by electing delegates for decision-
making, blending efficiency with decentralization (Allen et al., 2023). Nonetheless, reliance on a 
few representatives raises concerns about power consolidation and collusion.

Marketing and promoting through tokenomics. 
Marketing and promoting a token are crucial in the blockchain environment due to the 
inherent need to build and maintain a robust user network that enhances the token's utility and 
value. The effective promotion of a token catalyzes network effects, where the token's value 
increases with the number of users (Cong et al., 2020). This phenomenon is crucial for achieving 
critical mass, which is necessary for the token's sustainability and success. 
How entrepreneurs and ventures promote and market their tokens through 
communities. 
Entrepreneurs and ventures primarily promote their tokens by building communities 
around their platforms (see Table 9). This involves engaging potential and existing users through 
forums, social media, and direct engagement activities to foster a sense of ownership and 
involvement. Examples include platforms like Filecoin (a decentralized storage crypto project), 
where tokens are used for payment for services like data storage, creating a community of users 
who benefit directly from the network's growth (Cong et al., 2020). 
The authors emphasize the importance of marketing and promoting tokens to initiate 
network effects and foster community adoption. Effective promotion strategies are vital for 
establishing a user base that appreciates the token's value and contributes to its ecosystem. 
However, challenges remain, including the risk of attracting short-term users and the dependency 
on influencer partnerships, which may not always align with the token's strategic direction. 
Token design, by incorporating strategic marketing and community-building aspects, addresses 
blockchain governance hurdles, as seen in platforms like Ethereum, which employs a 
comprehensive approach to community engagement and consensus mechanisms. However, 

---

## Page 45

issues such as the potential for centralization and the need for continuous community 
engagement remain critical. 
Key resources. 
Raising capital (i.e., ICO, IDO). 
Funding is essential for blockchain projects as it provides the necessary capital to develop 
technology, maintain operations, and expand the ecosystem. Initial funding helps cover upfront 
costs crucial for technological development and achieving a sufficient level of decentralization 
necessary for the blockchain's security and trustworthiness (Conley, 2017) 
Likewise, maintaining liquidity is critical in a token-based blockchain project. Liquidity 
is crucial in token-based projects as it ensures that tokens can be easily traded without causing 
large price fluctuations. High liquidity attracts more users and investors, contributing to the 
overall health and stability of the ecosystem. Liquidity also plays a vital role in facilitating the 
use of tokens as a medium of exchange within the platform, thus enhancing their utility (Howell 
et al., 2019) 
Specific to Web3, entrepreneurs could utilize initial coin offerings (ICOs) to raise funds 
by issuing new tokens (Schückes & Gutmann, 2020). These tokens typically confer various 
rights, such as participation in project governance or claims on future revenues. The success of 
ICOs often relies on building strong communities around the projects, which contribute 
financially and help validate transactions while securing the network (Catalini & Gans, 2018). 
The authors cite some advantages and limitations of token funding vehicles: 
• Advantages:

o Broad access to capital: ICOs provide access to a global pool of investors, often more 
expansive than traditional funding routes. 
o Aligning interests: By holding tokens, investors and users are vested in the platform's 
success, aligning the interests across the ecosystem. 
• Limitations: 
o Regulatory uncertainty: The legal status of ICOs is still evolving, which can pose risks 
related to compliance with securities laws and regulations. 
o Market volatility: The value of tokens can be highly volatile, which might deter conservative 
investors and affect the stability of the funding base. 
Investors in token-based projects typically seek innovative solutions that solve real 
problems using blockchain technology. They assess the potential for large-scale adoption, the 
robustness of the underlying technology, the credibility of the team, and the clarity of the token 
economics model. They are mainly concerned with how well the token integrates within the 
ecosystem and its utility in driving platform engagement (Momtaz, 2021). 
Funding a token-based blockchain project is crucial for its development and operation 
(Schückes & Gutmann, 2020). Token-based blockchain projects introduce novel means of 
raising capital that bypass traditional financial intermediaries. Marketing and promoting the 
token effectively are crucial to kickstarting network effects and community adoption, which are 
vital to the project's success. However, challenges such as regulatory uncertainty, the potential 
for market manipulation, and the inherent volatility of tokens remain. These issues necessitate 
ongoing attention and adaptation to ensure the sustainable growth of token-based ecosystems.

Private token sales to venture capitalists and other early investors. 
In addition to public fundraising mechanisms such as ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings), IDOs 
(Initial Decentralized Offerings), and IEOs (Initial Exchange Offerings), as well as liquidity 
pools and private token sales to venture capitalists (VCs) and other early investors, represent a 
crucial aspect of the funding landscape for blockchain projects. Having blockchain technology-
based, reputable investors significantly enhances the success of blockchain projects, as their 
managerial capabilities and past experiences in the space contribute to this success (Hackober & 
Bock, 2021). These private sales are typically conducted before public offerings and involve 
selling tokens to select investors under negotiated terms and conditions. 
Private token sales, often called pre-sales or private placements, involve offering tokens 
to a limited group of investors, usually institutional investors, VCs, accredited investors, and 
high-net-worth individuals, before making them available to the general public. These sales are 
attractive to projects because they allow for the raising of substantial capital from a small 
number of committed investors. They also appeal to investors who can buy large amounts of 
tokens at a lower price, reflecting the early risk they take by investing before the broader market 
(Wandmacher, 2019). Table 12 describes the advantages and inconveniences of private token 
sales.  
Numerous high-profile blockchain projects have utilized private token sales, such as BNB 
from Binance or Ethereum. For example, EOS conducted one of the most significant private 
token sales, raising over $4 billion through a year-long ICO that included substantial private 
placements. Similarly, Filecoin raised substantial amounts from institutional investors prior to its 

---

46 
public ICO. More recently, StartkNet and EigenLayer IDOs have sparked much controversy for 
the same reasons. 
Private token sales to venture capitalists and other early investors are pivotal in the token 
funding ecosystem, providing essential capital and support to blockchain projects. These sales 
help projects mitigate the financial and operational risks of launching new technological 
platforms. However, the importance of structuring these sales to ensure long-term project 
stability and compliance with regulatory frameworks cannot be overstated. Despite their benefits, 
the challenges of managing investor expectations and providing a fair and stable post-public sale 
environment remain significant. As the blockchain industry matures, private sales strategies will 
likely evolve to balance these various concerns better. 
Key partners. 
Partnering with existing ecosystems, Layer 1, and Layer 2 projects is crucial in the 
blockchain industry due to several strategic, technical, and operational advantages (Schwarzer et 
al., 2022). These partnerships enable projects to leverage established networks and technologies, 
reducing the time and resources required to build them from scratch. Moreover, collaboration 
with other blockchain projects can enhance scalability, interoperability, and innovation, thereby 
improving the project’s overall value proposition. 
Entrepreneurs and ventures choose ecosystems and communities based on several factors, 
including technological compatibility, the reputation of the ecosystem, the regulatory 
environment, and the specific business needs of the project. Decision-makers use frameworks to 
evaluate potential consortia or ecosystems by considering strategic, organizational, social, and 
technical impacts. The decision to join an existing consortium versus building a new one is often 

---

## Page 49

 
 
 
 
47 
influenced by the potential for quicker and more efficient market penetration and resource 
utilization. Table 10 below summarizes the advantages and limitations of joining an existing 
blockchain ecosystem. 
Schwarzer et al. (2022) emphasize the importance of joining consortia or existing 
ecosystems, highlighting that such strategic decisions can significantly expedite development 
and enhance market penetration due to established network effects. For instance, enterprise 
blockchain consortia such as Hyperledger (an open-source blockchain project) and TradeLens (a 
blockchain-based global supply chain platform) are highlighted, demonstrating how they provide 
frameworks for collaboration across various industries, thereby enabling more efficient supply 
chain solutions and other enterprise applications. 
However, challenges such as integration difficulties, potential loss of autonomy, and risks 
of dependency remain. This nuanced view enables stakeholders to understand the critical factors 
in deciding between developing a new blockchain consortium and joining an existing one, 
ensuring that strategic alignments are met while navigating the complex landscape of blockchain 
technology and governance. 
Channels.  
Token-based ventures in the blockchain space thrive on robust community engagement 
and widespread token adoption (Wandmacher, 2019). A channel strategy is essential as it 
facilitates the dissemination of information and engages potential and existing community 
members (Allen et al., 2023). Channels like crypto X/Twitter, Discord, and Telegram provide 
real-time, dynamic interaction platforms that are vital for nurturing a community's trust and 
commitment. 

---

## Page 50

 
 
 
 
48 
Entrepreneurs and ventures choose channels based on their target audience's preferences 
and the specific interaction style of each platform. For instance, Discord and Telegram are 
preferred for ongoing community engagement due to their functionalities that support continuous 
and multifaceted communications (Li & Chen, 2023). Crypto events and influencer partnerships 
strategically reach broader audiences and lend credibility through association. Table 11 
summarizes the advantages and limitations of the main Web3 channels (see appendix). 
Authors argue that a well-designed token channel strategy is crucial for sparking network 
effects and is essential for the viral growth of the token's adoption (Allen et al., 2023). The 
channels not only facilitate the distribution and decentralization of the token but also empower 
the community by aligning incentives across the board, thereby enhancing the token's utility and 
value. For instance, the Ethereum Name Service's significant airdrop substantially increased user 
engagement and token adoption (Allen et al., 2023). Bored Ape Yacht Club’s use of NFTs for 
membership and community benefits illustrates how unique digital assets can drive exclusivity 
and community solidarity (Li & Chen, 2023). 
However, issues such as regulatory uncertainty and the scalability of engagement 
methods remain challenges that must be addressed to sustain long-term growth and community 
involvement. 
Customer relationship. 
A robust customer relationship strategy in the blockchain space is crucial because it 
transcends traditional interaction frameworks, enabling businesses to engage with their audience 
more quickly (Li & Chen, 2023; Van de Vyver, 2023). In token-based ventures, this relationship 
is not merely transactional but involves creating a community around the token, which enhances 

---

## Page 51

 
 
 
 
49 
trust and loyalty. The intrinsic transparency of blockchain ensures that customers can verify the 
authenticity and fairness of transactions, fostering a deeper connection between the project and 
its users (Fairfield, 2022). 
In the tokenomics ecosystem, several vital players include investors, users, 
miners/validators, developers, L1/L2 partners, and other ecosystem players. Successful ventures 
navigate these relationships by providing investors and users with clear, frequent communication 
and updates. This includes transparency regarding token utility, rewards, and governance rights, 
which fosters a sense of ownership and belonging (Li & Chen, 2023). Miners/validators should 
appropriately recognize and reward their contributions (Han et al., 2022). This involves equitable 
token distribution and incentives to maintain the network's integrity and security (Van de Vyver, 
2023). Then, developers collaborate on continuous improvement and innovation. Token-based 
ventures often open-source their code or offer bounties for development, encouraging a vibrant 
developer community (Fairfield, 2022). Finally, for the L2 partners and ecosystem players, the 
token venture establishes strategic alliances and integration. The token venture establishes 
strategic partnerships and integrations for L1/L2 partners and ecosystem players to enhance the 
token's utility and reach. This includes cross-chain collaborations and partnerships with other 
platforms and services (Van de Vyver, 2023). The authors mention some token-related 
community, relationship, and PR advantages and limitations, as shown in Table 13 (see 
appendix). 
The authors argue that maintaining robust token customer relationship management is 
vital for fostering network effects, flywheels, and community adoption. This relationship 
management helps scale the user base and enhance the token's utility and value over time (Li & 

---

## Page 52

 
 
 
 
50 
Chen, 2023; Van de Vyver, 2023). However, issues such as regulatory compliance, market 
volatility, and the complexity of managing decentralized communities persist, posing challenges 
that require strategic responses (Fairfield, 2022). 
Customer segments. 
The five primary customer segments identified for token-based projects include 
developers who build on the platform and contribute to its functionality and growth. They are 
essential for evolving the platform's capabilities, attracting more users, and enhancing the utility 
of the token. Secondly, users are individuals or entities that utilize the platform for its intended 
services and benefit from the ecosystem's offerings. They are instrumental in driving the network 
effect by increasing the platform's value as more individuals join and use the services. Then, the 
investors and stakeholders who purchase or yield farm the tokens often speculate on future 
growth or participate in governance. This segment provides initial and ongoing capital, helping 
to bootstrap the network and sustain liquidity. In addition, miners (PoW) or Validators (PoS) 
help maintain the blockchain epoch's security, integrity, and functionality by validating, 
securing, and propagating transactions across the network. They ensure trust and security, 
keeping the platform's decentralized nature. Lastly, some contributors, such as content creators 
or marketers, may not fit neatly into the other categories but provide value. They help amplify 
the platform's reach and appeal, fostering a broader community and enhancing user experience. 
The authors (Cong et al., 2020) discuss some advantages and limitations of pursuing these 
segments, as presented in Table 14 (see appendix). 
The authors highlight that maintaining a vibrant customer segment community is pivotal 
for token-based ventures to harness network effects, create flywheels for adoption, and foster 

---

## Page 53

 
 
 
 
51 
community engagement. This multifaceted approach catalyzes growth and stabilizes the 
ecosystem, leveraging each segment's unique contributions. However, challenges such as 
regulatory risks, market volatility, and the need for ongoing engagement with all segments 
remain persistent issues that require strategic management. 
Revenue streams. 
Entrepreneurs must focus on on-chain and off-chain revenue streams to ensure a 
diversified income source that supports sustained growth and reduces dependence on market 
conditions (Y. Chen & Bellavitis, 2020). On-chain revenues are inherently scalable and align 
with the development of the blockchain network. In contrast, off-chain revenues provide stability 
and can support operations during periods of low network activity (Van de Vyver, M., 2023). 
Table 15 (see appendix) provides a description and summary of the main on-chain and off-chain 
revenues.  Table 16 (see appendix) presents five real-world examples of token-based ventures 
that illustrate how they can diversify their revenue streams by combining token utility, platform 
fees, and strategic services to create robust economic models that support their ecosystems. 
The authors argue that maintaining and increasing diverse revenue streams is critical for 
ensuring the financial sustainability of a token-based venture. Effective revenue management 
helps balance growth, liquidity, and equitable fee distribution among validators and users, which 
is crucial for fostering network effects and community adoption. However, regulatory 
uncertainties, market volatility, and dependence on continuous user and developer engagement 
remain significant hurdles.

Cost structure 
Entrepreneurs must meticulously manage both on-chain and off-chain costs to ensure 
long-term sustainability and prevent over-leveraging project resources (Y. Chen & Bellavitis, 
2020). Effective cost management impacts the project's ability to scale, maintain security, and 
incentivize participants without eroding the token's value (H. M. Kim et al., 2021). Table 16 (see 
appendix) summarizes the on-chain and off-chain costs. 
The analyzed literature emphasizes that a well-structured cost framework facilitates 
growth and liquidity, balancing validators' fees and user costs (Yunshu Liu et al., 2021). This 
balance is crucial for fostering sustainability, network effects, flywheels, and community 
adoption, which are necessary for the long-term success of a token-based venture, as 
demonstrated by the authors' examples of Insolar and Steemit. 
Firstly, Insolar demonstrates the balance of subsidizing users and developers to grow 
network effects despite the challenges in developer adoption due to technical complexities (H. 
M. Kim et al., 2021). 
Secondly, Steemit uses token incentives to encourage content creation (M. S. Kim & 
Chung, 2018). A high token value did not equate to high-quality content, highlighting the 
limitations of incentives without adequate quality controls (Zhang et al., 2019). 
However, challenges such as token value volatility and misaligned incentives remain 
pervasive issues needing strategic oversight (K. Chen et al., 2023).

Critique of the Extant Literature to Identify the Future of Practice and Policy  
 
Token design often lacks a coherent framework and does not adequately consider the 
underlying business model. This issue is common across many token-based projects, which are 
frequently developed haphazardly with little regard for their integration into the broader business 
environment. Consequently, a significant challenge in token design is ensuring its utility and 
boosting its intrinsic value by aligning it with suitable functionalities while maintaining 
compatibility (Oliveira et al., 2018). This literature review highlights the issue of token design in 
the blockchain sector and emphasizes the need for a structured approach to promote long-term 
stakeholder engagement. The literature review of 53 articles is divided into four themes: 
• Tokenomics business model innovation (TBMI): 31 articles. 
• Governance token aspects (GTA): 12 articles. 
• Blockchain innovative disruption aspect (BIDA): 6 articles. 
• Token financing innovation (TFI): 4 articles. 
To frame the 53 articles with the four main themes within a systemic structural approach, 
we proposed using the Business Model Canvas by Osterwalder and Pigneur (2010) as a 
conceptual framework. This method provides a systematic approach to designing and 
comprehending business models, is widely recognized, thoroughly tested across various 
industries, and is well-understood by practitioners and entrepreneurs alike.  
We have classified the articles by business model elements' relevance as follows (please 
note that 1 article can address more than one business model element): 
• Key partners: 12 

---

## Page 56

 
 
 
 
54 
• Key activities: 24 
• Key resources: 13 
• Value proposition: 30 
• Customer relationship: 13 
• Channels: 15 
• Customer segments: 7 
• Cost structure: 9 
• Revenue streams: 9 
Looking at the article distribution result, as shown in Table 3 in the appendices, one can 
argue that most articles address the TBMI themes by 58%, to a lesser extent, Governance by 
23%, the innovative disruption aspect of blockchain by 11%, and token financing innovation by 
roughly 8%. 
Looking from the BMC perspective and taking a higher-level view, we can regroup the 
nine elements into three: 
• Feasibility: regrouping all activities referring to the how or capacity needed to create, 
produce, and launch a product, service, or venture project, tangible or intangible 
• Desirability: regrouping the activities relating to the attractiveness of the product, 
service, and venture project for direct or indirect participants  
• Viability: regrouping activities regarding the financial, profitability, and monetization 
aspects of the product, service, and venture projects. 
One can observe that the 3 BMC domain coverages are unequal. Desirability is more 
covered than viability and feasibility. There are significant discrepancies among the nine

55 
elements, where the value proposition is overrepresented (roughly ~23%) compared to revenue 
and cost at 6,8% respectively, customer segments (5,3%), and key partners (9,1%). 
The literature review classification analysis reveals that some token design areas (token 
utility, functions, and consensus) are well covered and discussed in academic circles, while 
others are under-addressed. 
• Token ecosystem dynamics: How does design help attract and foster a vibrant 
ecosystem? 
• Ecosystem players dynamics: How does the token design consideration help build, 
maintain, and grow? 
• Security through token design: how token design addresses network security and 
integrity? 
• Funding consideration in token design: How does tokenomics help attract, maintain, 
and grow liquidity pools, LTV (loan-to-value), and FDV (fully diluted value)? 
• Token governance: How can token design enhance coordination and decision-making 
among token holders reasonably and efficiently? 
• On-chain and off-chain costs: What costs bring more token value to the network and 
when? 
• On-chain and off-chain revenue streams: Which revenue streams increase token value 
and should be looked for in time and space? 
There is a lack of emphasis on the user experience and adoption aspects of crypto 
projects. While not explicitly mentioned in the data, the ease of use and accessibility of dApps 
and decentralized ledgers are critical as follows: 

---

## Page 58

 
 
 
 
56 
• User-friendly interfaces: Given the complex nature of blockchain technology, 
designing user-friendly interfaces is crucial for broader adoption. Interfaces must be 
intuitive and accessible to users without technical expertise. 
• Simplifying complex concepts: The user experience (UX) should aim to simplify and 
effectively communicate complex blockchain concepts, like transactions, gas fees, 
wallets, and private keys.  
• Seamless integration: For broader adoption, blockchain applications must integrate 
seamlessly with existing systems and platforms that users are already familiar with. 
• Cross-platform usability: Ensuring that applications are cross-platform and function 
consistently across different devices and operating systems is essential for user 
convenience. 
While some improvements are being made, like the account abstraction EIP-4337 in 
Ethereum and other layer one networks, such as Sui or Solana, have seen timid adoption.  
 
Discussion and Implications of the Integrative Literature Review  
The findings of this integrative literature review on designing successful tokens for 
cryptocurrency ventures via strategies for entrepreneurial success support most of the prior 
literature's findings concerning the significance of structured tokenomics, the importance of 
alignment among stakeholders, and the need to achieve equilibrium between short-term and 
long-term incentives. Previous studies have stressed the importance of straightforward token 
utility, governance, and security as being necessary elements for successful blockchain ventures 
(Oliveira et al., 2018; Schubert et al., 2021), however there were some divergent findings,

57 
notably, the lack of representation of comprehensive frameworks that include business models to 
guide the development of token design, indicating a disparity between theoretical approaches to 
developing tokenomics and practical implementations. 
Unforeseen results indicated an inadequate inclusion of user experience and adoption 
measures within previous token design literature. These differences may result from the 
relatively newness of the blockchain field, where technical and economic issues have historically 
been given precedence over user-centered concerns. Future research will need to incorporate 
these aspects to provide a more comprehensive perspective on tokenomics, encompassing both 
user engagement and accessibility. 
Several factors influenced the interpretation of the results of this ILR, including the 
rapidly evolving technological landscape of blockchain, regulatory changes, and the diverse 
environments in which tokens are utilized. As a result of the rapidly changing environment in the 
crypto market, findings from even one year ago may already be obsolete. Additionally, the 
diverse regulatory environments found in numerous jurisdictions worldwide can significantly 
impact the design of tokens and their implementation, potentially limiting the generalizability of 
specific results. 
The results of this ILR study directly address the study problem by identifying the key 
elements of token design that foster long-term commitment among stakeholders and the viability 
of a project. Furthermore, by integrating prior literature, this review provides new insights into 
the integration of business model frameworks, such as the BMC, into token design, thereby 
offering a structured method for designing tokens that align with the objectives of entrepreneurs 
and the needs of markets. This review presents an integrative approach to developing 

---

58 
tokenomics, bridging theoretical gaps and providing practical guidance for entrepreneurs 
navigating the complexities of tokenomics. 
The findings of this ILR study have significant implications for business and managerial 
practices in the blockchain space. Entrepreneurially minded individuals can utilize the insights 
on structured tokenomics to develop tokens that generate early investment and promote sustained 
growth and engagement. The incorporation of the BMC framework ensures that the token design 
aligns with broader business strategies, thereby increasing the potential for creating value. The 
necessity of managing the balance between the structure of incentives, compliance with 
regulatory requirements, and user engagement is important for all managers. Effective token 
design can lead to improved resource allocation, better relationships with stakeholders, and 
increased project sustainability. Managers should continually innovate in terms of token utility to 
keep users engaged and interested, thereby creating value in the long term. 
This ILR study offers new insights, providing a comprehensive framework for token 
design that can be applied across various blockchain projects. The study emphasizes the use of 
structured methods and the alignment of stakeholders' interests to enhance transparency, fairness, 
and sustainability in the cryptocurrency space. 
The findings of this ILR study offer tangible benefits for entrepreneurially minded 
individuals and managers in the blockchain industry. By utilizing the proposed structured 
method of designing tokens, projects can align their token designs with market needs, regulatory 
requirements, and stakeholder expectations. Increased investment, adoption of products or 
services, and overall project success can occur when projects are aligned with market needs, 
regulatory requirements, and stakeholder expectations.

Future research should focus on improving and refining token design frameworks to 
incorporate evolving user behavior and market dynamics. In addition, investigating the impact of 
emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and DeFi, on tokenomics will provide 
greater insight into the future of digital assets. 
It is important to avoid overstating the applicability of the study's findings. The study's 
recommendations and insights were based on current literature and market conditions, which are 
subject to rapid change. Although the structured approach to designing tokens provides a solid 
foundation of knowledge, it must be adapted to fit the specific needs of each project context and 
the evolving regulatory environments of each jurisdiction. 
In conclusion, this integrative literature review has provided valuable insights and 
practical recommendations for entrepreneurs and managers in the blockchain sector. By 
addressing the study's problem and purpose, contributing new knowledge, and achieving 
alignment with broader social goals, the study has contributed to the understanding of the design 
of successful tokens and their implications for entrepreneurial success. Continuous adaptation 
and innovation are necessary to remain relevant in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. 
 
Future Recommendations  
Building on the above-stated strengths and weaknesses of this ILR, several proposals 
were made for future research. To begin with, one needs to consider token design based on the 
users themselves, as there has been little to no work done on user experience and the adoption of 
tokenomics. Future research should therefore explore user-centric approaches to creating and 
using tokens. Examples of potential user-centric studies include examining the types of user 

---

## Page 62

 
 
 
 
60 
behavior that affect token usage and long-term engagement. The recommendation to research 
user-centric token design stems from the finding that a significant gap currently exists between 
integrating user-centric views into token design models (Oliveira et al., 2018). 
To follow, one needs to explore the effect of regulatory changes on token design. Since 
regulatory landscapes are likely to continue evolving, it is essential to assess how regulatory 
changes may impact the creation of tokens and the overall viability of a project, such as a 
stablecoin. One area for research could be to determine the effects of varying regulatory 
environments on the tokenomics and to recommend adaptable strategies for entrepreneurs. 
This recommendation is based on the study's findings that regulatory compliance is a 
challenging yet essential component of successfully designing tokens (Schubert et al., 2021). 
Following this, one needs to find a way to incorporate emerging technologies with 
tokenomics. Emerging technologies, such as AI and DeFi, as well as other similar innovations, 
could offer new opportunities for enhancing both the functionality and security of tokens. 
Research could be conducted to see if these technologies can enhance aspects of token design, 
such as scalability, interoperability, and user engagement. This recommendation comes from the 
study's emphasis on the importance of ongoing innovation in token usage (Conley, 2017). 
Additionally, longitudinal studies on token performance are necessary. Recent 
longitudinal studies have been conducted, but they have not explicitly addressed token design 
(Alexander, 2025; Cernera et al., 2024). By conducting longitudinal studies, researchers can gain 
valuable knowledge about the long-term viability and success factors of token-based projects by 
tracking the performance of tokens over time. This type of research would also enable the

61 
validation of the findings of this ILR by evaluating real-world uses and results over extended 
periods. 
Furthermore, one needs to research tokenomics in multiple contexts. By researching and 
incorporating a broader range of contexts (such as diverse industries and geographic locations), 
researchers can gain a deeper understanding of tokenomics. This recommendation was made due 
to the limited scope of this study, which primarily focused on a single industry segment within 
the blockchain ecosystem. 
Future researchers can build upon this study by selecting a more varied and inclusive 
literature base to provide greater diversity and inclusion for geographic regions and blockchain 
applications. In addition, future researchers can benefit from using primary data collection 
techniques, such as surveys and interviews with blockchain entrepreneurs and users, to provide a 
richer set of insights and validate the findings of this ILR. 
As mentioned previously, the most natural continuation of this research is to establish and 
empirically test a token design model that includes user-centric metrics, adaptability to 
regulatory changes, and emerging technology. A key component of establishing a token design 
model is validating the model through case studies and testing it in real-world settings to ensure 
that the model is both relevant and practical. 
 
Conclusions 
 
The results of this study demonstrate the importance of having a solid, structured 
tokenomics to ensure the success of a blockchain project. This study has demonstrated the 
importance of having the right tokens designed to align with a business's operational framework, 

---

ensuring compliance with regulations, and maintaining user engagement over time, thereby 
creating a viable and long-term project that stakeholders are committed to. For example, one way 
to help ensure strategic alignment for blockchain projects is to use the Business Model Canvas 
when designing tokens, thereby ensuring the long-term sustainability of blockchain projects 
(Osterwalder & Pigneur, 2010). 
In summary, this integrative literature review provides a solid foundation for different 
token design strategies and their impact on entrepreneurs' success in the blockchain sector. The 
study offers valuable insights and practical guidance to researchers and practitioners by 
addressing current gaps and providing a structured approach to tokenomics. 
In conclusion, the study confirms again that an effective token design is not only a 
technical challenge but also a strategic imperative that needs a comprehensive and flexible 
approach. By employing structured approaches, regulatory knowledge, and user-oriented 
measures, entrepreneurs can develop robust and stable token-based ecosystems that encourage 
innovation and sustainably stimulate users in the long term. Therefore, the integrative literature 
review provides the necessary foundation for further studies, enabling the field of tokenomics to 
develop and supporting the sustainable growth of the blockchain sector.

 BMC Components Description in Blockchain Context 
Components Blockchain components description 
Value propositions The value proposition in a blockchain project often revolves around decentralization, 
security, and scalability. For tokenomics, the value might also include the utility, 
governance, or financial returns the token offers its holders. For example, a 
blockchain project might provide a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that enables 
users to lend, borrow, or earn interest on cryptocurrencies without relying on 
traditional financial intermediaries, offering clear benefits in terms of accessibility and 
potential earnings. 
Customer segments Customer segments in blockchain are diverse, including retail investors, traders, 
developers, enterprises, and more. Understanding these segments is crucial for 
designing tokenomics that cater to the needs and motivations of each group. For 
example, a blockchain platform may target developers by offering them a robust 
environment for building and deploying decentralized applications (dApps), or 
investors seeking governance tokens that enable them to participate in decision-
making processes. 
Channels Channels in blockchain projects include cryptocurrency exchanges, online forums, 
social media platforms, and blockchain-specific communication platforms, such as 
Discord or Telegram. These channels are crucial for distributing tokens, sharing 
project updates, and fostering community engagement. For instance, a project might 
utilize a combination of an initial coin offering (ICO) through its website and listings on 
major cryptocurrency exchanges as channels to efficiently distribute its tokens to a 
broad audience. 
Customer 
relationships 
Building trust and fostering community engagement are central to customer 
relationships in blockchain projects. This can involve transparent communication, 
community governance models, and ongoing support and incentives. For example, 
regularly engaging with the community through AMAs (Ask Me Anything) sessions, 
providing transparent updates on project development, and involving token holders in 
governance decisions can help strengthen relationships.

Key resources The blockchain infrastructure (e.g., Ethereum for smart contracts), the token itself, 
skilled developers, and a supportive community are key components of blockchain 
projects. These resources are essential for developing and maintaining the project. 
For example, access to a high-performance blockchain network and a team of 
experienced blockchain developers are critical resources for launching and scaling a 
successful DeFi project. 
Key activities Key activities involve developing blockchain technology, maintaining network security, 
conducting smart contract audits, community management, and marketing. These 
activities are crucial for the project's success and growth. For example, all key 
activities are regularly updating the platform's software, ensuring the security of 
smart contracts through audits, and actively engaging with the community and 
stakeholders. 
Key partnerships Partnerships with other blockchain projects, exchanges, regulatory bodies, and 
technology providers can enhance a project's credibility, expand its ecosystem, and 
access new users and markets. For example, forming partnerships with established 
cryptocurrency exchanges for token listing, collaborating with other DeFi projects for 
cross-platform functionality, or working with regulatory consultants to navigate the 
legal landscape. 
Cost structure The cost structure in blockchain projects includes the costs associated with blockchain 
operations (e.g., gas fees for transactions), development and maintenance costs, 
marketing, and community engagement efforts. Designing a sustainable cost structure 
is vital for long-term viability. For example, managing the balance between 
operational costs (such as gas fees for executing smart contracts) and revenue 
streams is critical to ensure the project remains financially sustainable. 
Revenue streams Revenue streams in blockchain projects can include transaction fees, service fees, 
network fees, or earnings from staking. Tokenomics design must ensure these 
revenue streams align with the long-term sustainability of the project and the value it 
delivers to its users. For example, a blockchain platform could generate revenue 
through small transaction fees on each trade or financial operation conducted on the 
platform or through staking mechanisms where users lock up tokens to earn rewards.

Token Design Considerations and Functions 
Token design considerations Token functions 
Underlying value: Tokens must have an inherent 
value, representing real-world assets, services, or 
rights within the ecosystem (Khaqqi et al., 2018). 
The design should clearly indicate whether tokens 
Medium of exchange: Tokens can facilitate 
transactions within the ecosystem, acting as a 
medium of exchange for goods, services, or 
assets. This utility enhances liquidity and 
participant interaction.

are utility, security, or hybrid, which will influence 
their regulatory treatment and market perception. 
Distribution mechanisms: The token distribution 
method at the Token Generation Event (TGE) has a 
significant impact on the decentralization and 
fairness of the token economy. Designers must 
choose between initial coin offerings (ICOs), 
airdrops, staking rewards, or earning mechanisms 
to distribute tokens to participants. 
Store of value: Designing tokens as a store of 
value encourages long-term holding and 
investment, stabilizing the ecosystem. Key 
considerations include mechanisms to support 
value retention and mitigate volatility. 
Supply dynamics: A fixed, inflationary, or 
deflationary supply can influence token value. 
Considerations include mechanisms for token 
creation, burning, and the impact of supply changes 
on token economics (Schubert et al., 2021). 
Unit of account: Tokens can serve as a unit 
of account, providing a standard measure of 
value within the ecosystem. This function is 
crucial for pricing goods, services, and assets 
in a consistent manner. 
Governance and decentralization: Token 
governance structures determine how decisions are 
made within the ecosystem, impacting 
decentralization and participant engagement. 
Design choices range from fully decentralized 
autonomous organizations (DAOs) to more 
centralized governance models (Khaqqi et al., 
2018). 
Rights and access: Tokens can grant rights or 
access to specific ecosystem features, 
services, or governance. This includes voting 
rights, access to premium content, or 
participation in decision-making processes.

Legal and regulatory compliance: Depending on 
the token's classification (i.e., utility, security), 
designers must ensure compliance with relevant 
legal and regulatory frameworks that affect the 
token's design, distribution, and use cases. 
Incentives and rewards: The token economy 
can incentivize desired behaviors, such as 
content creation, network security, or 
participation in governance. Reward 
mechanisms must be carefully designed to 
align participants' actions with ecosystem 
goals.

 Token Value Enhancers and Inhibitors 
Token value 
factors 
Token value enhancers Token value inhibitors 
User adoption: The value of a token is intricately 
linked to its adoption rate among 
users, with higher adoption 
suggesting strong demand and, 
consequently, increased token value. 
Tokens that offer clear benefits and 
ease of use generally experience 
heightened adoption (Wandmacher, 
2019). 
Combining multiple tokens is not 
merely additive. The amalgamation of 
numerous tokens within an ecosystem 
does not linearly enhance value; it may 
introduce complexity and potentially 
diminish the value of individual tokens 
(Tan, 2019).

Expected future 
utility: 
Tokens perceived to possess 
significant future utility tend to hold 
greater value today. This future utility 
could stem from platform 
advancements, strategic partnerships, 
and broader application scenarios, 
enticing users and investors alike 
(Tan, 2019). 
Over time, token impact diminishes. 
Tokens may lose their initial impact as 
users acclimatize, requiring ongoing 
token utility and design innovation to 
maintain interest and value. 
 
Risks and ethics The riskiness of the token. A token's 
value is also influenced by its 
associated risks, including regulatory 
uncertainties, potential technological 
vulnerabilities, and market volatility. 
Reduced perceived risks contribute to 
elevated token values. 
 
Ethics matters in sensible domains. 
Ethical considerations, especially 
concerning data privacy and quality, 
are crucial. Token designs must uphold 
user privacy and foster high-quality 
data (Wandmacher, 2019). 
 
Token price 
volatility 
 The volatility of token prices can 
impede adoption and investment. 
Mechanisms for stabilization and clear 
demonstrations of long-term utility can 
help mitigate these concerns (Khaqqi 
et al., 2018).

trade-off 
Scalability and decentralization trade-
off. Efficiently scale platforms while 
maintaining robust decentralization 
attributes to higher token values, 
ensuring the platform can 
accommodate growth without 
compromising security or control 
(Khaqqi et al., 2018). 
Scalability and security. Achieving 
scalability without compromising 
security is essential for sustaining 
token value. Platforms that manage 
this balance support higher token 
valuations (Tan, 2019).

Smart contract 
audits: 
Regular audits of 
smart contracts can

vulnerabilities before 
they are exploited, 
securing the 
blockchain against 
potential attacks. 
Smart contract audits can be costly and time-
consuming, and might not catch all vulnerabilities, 
especially in complex contracts. 
 
Sybil attack

Implementing 
reputation systems 
like MeritRank 
provides a Sybil-

benefits of Sybil 
attacks, securing the 
network by ensuring 
Reputation-based systems require careful 
parameter tuning to strike a balance between Sybil

Decentralized 
autonomous 
organizations 
(DAOs): 
DAOs represent a 
radical shift from 
traditional governance 
structures, operating 
through smart contracts 
that automate decisions 
without central 
authority based on 
community votes 
(Beck et al., 2018). 
DAOs are vulnerable to voting apathy and the 
potential for a small group of stakeholders to 
control outcomes if they hold a majority of 
tokens. 
 
Token staking and 
voting: 
Token holders can 
participate in 
governance decisions 
by staking tokens and 
voting on proposals. 
This method secures 
the network and 
empowers token 
holders to influence the 
project's direction 
(Cong et al., 2020). 
Token Staking and Voting can lead to 
centralization if the token distribution is skewed 
towards large holders, potentially giving them 
disproportionate control over decisions.

Delegated proof of 
stake (DPoS): 
In DPoS systems, 
token holders elect 
delegates to make 
decisions on their 
behalf, enhancing 
scalability and 
efficiency while 
ensuring 
decentralization (Allen 
et al., 2023). 
DPoS is criticized for being less decentralized, as 
it relies on a small number of elected officials to 
make decisions, which could lead to power 
consolidation and increased risks of collusion 
(Allen et al., 2023).

Table 10 
Private Token Sales Advantages and Inconveniences. 
Private token sales advantages and inconveniences 
Advantages Inconveniences 
Early and substantial funding: Projects can 
secure significant initial capital to fund 
development and go-to-market strategies without 
immediately needing to appeal to a broader public 
market. 
Exclusivity: By nature, private sales exclude 
smaller or individual investors, which can 
sometimes lead to criticisms regarding the 
equitable distribution of tokens and the 
centralization of token ownership. 
Strategic partnerships: VCs and institutional 
investors often bring more than just capital. They 
can offer expertise, industry connections, and 
credibility that can help a project succeed beyond 
its initial phases. 
Regulatory concerns: Private sales must be 
carefully structured to comply with securities laws 
in various jurisdictions. Failure to do so can lead 
to legal complications and potential sanctions. 
 
Reduced volatility: By securing significant 
funding from stable sources, projects can mitigate 
some of the volatility associated with broader 
public sales, where speculation can lead to 
substantial price fluctuations. 
 
Potential for early sell-offs: If not correctly 
structured with vesting periods or other incentives 
to hold, early investors may dump their tokens on 
the market once they become publicly tradable, 
potentially leading to a sharp decline in price.

Lack of control: Projects may have limited 
control over the ecosystem’s development and 
governance. 
Network effects: Joining an established network 
can provide immediate access to a broader user 
base and potential customers, enhancing network 
effects. 
Dependency risks: There is a risk of becoming 
dependent on the host ecosystem’s technology and 
market health. 
 
Technical and strategic support: Existing 
ecosystems often provide technical infrastructure 
and strategic guidance, which can be invaluable for 
new ventures. 
Integration challenges: Technical and 
operational challenges may arise in aligning the 
new project’s objectives with the existing 
ecosystem’s protocols and standards.

communities. 
Managing these platforms requires 
constant moderation to prevent the 
spread of misinformation and maintain 
high-quality engagement. 
Influencers and 
Sponsorships 
This can rapidly amplify a 
token’s visibility and adoption. 
It may risk dependency on the
