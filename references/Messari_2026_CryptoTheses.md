Introduction 
Welcome to the 2026 edition of The Theses! 
 
2025 was perhaps one of the most polarizing years for the crypto industry. Your ultimate view of the year depends largely on who you are. If 
you’re reading this report while sitting in an oﬃce overlooking Wall Street, it’s been your best year in crypto…ever. And if you’re at the opposite 
end of the spectrum, perhaps a trench warrior spending 12+ hours a day lurking in Telegram and Discord chats, you’re probably longing for the 
times of yesterday. If anything, 2025 proved that our industry is just as volatile as the price charts we spend all day looking at: 
● We started oﬀ the year with, in retrospect, the most exhilarating token launch of all time: TRUMP. Although the euphoria from it quickly 
subsided, it was a valuable stress test and helped prove just how far onchain infrastructure has come. 
● The largest government in the world proclaimed Bitcoin a unique store of value, made it oﬃcial policy to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset, 
and even left the door open for future budget-neutral acquisitions. Just two years ago, this would have seemed like a fantasy beyond our 
wildest imaginations. 
● The identity crisis that has plagued Ethereum for the past two years ﬁnally reached its climax, and Ethereum is better for it. Ethereum is 
now solidifying its position as the center of institutional adoption. 
● DATs became the hot topic, and their collective bid pushed the asset class to new all-time highs. 
● The ﬁrst landmark U.S. crypto legislation, GENIUS, was signed into law, laying the groundwork for what the U.S. Treasury Secretary 
expects could scale into trillions of dollars in stablecoins. 
● The largest crypto deleveraging event in history occurred on October 10, with many assets dropping by 50% or more in minutes, and some 
assets even brieﬂy trading at zero (literal zero). Since then, crypto has struggled to keep pace with other asset classes it has historically 
correlated with, including gold, silver, and equities. 
● The businesses of tomorrow are being built onchain. On a per-employee basis, Hyperliquid and Tether may be among the most proﬁtable 
companies ever. Applications like Polymarket and pump.fun crossed the chasm and entered the zeitgeist. 
Through it all, Messari Research has kept you up to speed. We released hallmark reports on two of the year’s biggest megatrends: stablecoins and 
AI. Our early 2024 Hyperliquid call was vindicated, and we covered its ascension throughout the year. As the industry began questioning how to 
value cryptoassets, we published valuation frameworks across a wide range of sectors, including L1s, DePIN, lending protocols, and more niche 
assets, such as launchpads and AI hedge funds. We remained nimble enough to cover everything from Trump’s tariﬀ policy and its downstream 
eﬀects on crypto to how tokenization could revolutionize the collectibles industry and bring Pokémon cards onchain. Our Protocol Services team 
has partnered with over 150 protocols, providing objective insights to advance the space.

There are seven main sections in this year’s Theses, centered around Cryptomoney, TradFi, Chains, DeFi, AI, DePIN, and Consumer. Within these 
sections, we delve into what we believe are the most important narratives and themes for the years to come. After these seven main sections, 
we’ve also included familiar favorites like Messari Analyst Picks and the Messari Awards. New to this year’s Theses is the Alumni Theses, which 
includes write-ups from Messari alumni who are driving the industry forward. Finally, we’ve included a sneak peek at a new framework we’ve 
been working on: the Disruption Factor. 
This is a free report that we are releasing to all Messari subscribers. If you get value out of The Theses, consider a Messari subscription (discount

Key Themes 
● Bitcoin has ﬁrmly established itself apart from all other cryptoassets and is undoubtedly the leading form of cryptomoney. 
● BTC underperformance in the second half of this year can be partly attributed to increased sell pressure from older, large-balance holders. 
We don’t see any strong reasons for this underperformance to become a long-term structural issue and expect BTC’s monetary narrative to 
remain intact for the foreseeable future. 
● L1 valuations are becoming increasingly detached from their fundamentals. L1 revenues have declined signiﬁcantly year-over-year, 
meaning their valuations are increasingly predicated upon the notion of a monetary premium. Barring a few outliers, we expect L1s to 
underperform BTC. 
● ETH remains the most hotly contested asset. Concerns over value accrual haven’t been fully alleviated, but the second half of 2025 proved 
that the market is willing to treat it as cryptomoney in the same vein as BTC. A “second life” for Ethereum DATs could emerge if a crypto 
bull market returns in 2026. 
● ZEC is increasingly being priced as a form of private cryptomoney rather than a niche privacy coin, positioning it as a complementary 
hedge to BTC in an era of rising surveillance, institutional capture, and ﬁnancial repression.

● Applications may begin to opt for their own monetary systems rather than relying on the native assets of the networks they exist on. 
Applications with social elements and strong network eﬀects are prime candidates to do so. 
Introduction 
It’s no mistake that we’re opening this year’s Theses with a discussion on the most fundamentally important part of the crypto revolution: money. 
When we initially began planning for the Theses over the summer, we never would’ve imagined how far the pendulum would swing to negative 
sentiment. 
 
In November 2025, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index sank to a 10, “Extreme Fear.” Prior to this year, the only other times it printed a 10 or lower 
were: 
● The Luna collapse and 3AC contagion in May-June 2022 
● The mass liquidation cascade in May 2021

● Various points during the 2018-2019 bear market 
Sentiment in crypto has only been lower a handful of times in its entire history, and only when the industry was genuinely collapsing in on itself, 
and the future was truly in doubt. Yet that is clearly not what’s happening today. No major exchanges have disappeared with user funds, no blatant 
ponzi schemes are commanding decabillion valuations, and total market cap isn’t breaking below prior cycle highs. 
Instead, crypto is being recognized and integrated at the highest levels of global institutions. The SEC is openly expecting all U.S. markets to be 
onchain within two years. Stablecoin supply is at an all-time high. All the ‘someday’ adoption narratives we repeated for a decade are ﬁnally 
materializing, and yet, it has almost never felt worse. Almost every other week, a viral post circulates on X from someone convinced they wasted 
their life on crypto, or declaring that everything this industry built will simply be forked, co-opted, and captured by incumbent institutions. 
Amidst this disconnect between collapsing sentiment and rising institutional adoption, it’s the perfect time to revisit crypto from ﬁrst principles. 
And the original principle, the one that has since spawned this chaotic, beautiful industry we’ve all come to love, is simple: build a better, 
alternative monetary system than the ﬁat system we have today. That ideal has been embedded in the industry’s DNA since the genesis Bitcoin 
block, which famously included the message: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”

These origins matter because, somewhere along the way, many people have forgotten what crypto was for. Bitcoin wasn’t created to give banks 
better settlement rails. It wasn’t created to shave a few basis points oﬀ FX transfers. And it wasn’t created to power an endless slot machine of 
speculative tokens. It was created as a response to a failing monetary system. 
So if we’re going to make sense of where crypto stands today, we need to return to the core issue at the center of the entire industry: why 
cryptomoney matters at all. 
Why Cryptomoney? 
For most of modern history, people have had no meaningful choice in the kind of money they use. Under today’s ﬁat-based global monetary order, 
people are eﬀectively captive to the currency of their home country and the decisions of that country’s central bank. The state decides the money 
you earn in, the money you save in, and the money you pay taxes in. Whether that currency inﬂates, depreciates, or is mismanaged, you’re stuck 
with it. And across nearly every type of political and economic system, free-market, authoritarian, or developing, the same pattern emerges. 
Government debt is a one-way street.

Over the past quarter-century, the world’s largest economies have all taken on substantially more debt relative to their GDP. The United States and 
China, the two largest economies, have had their general government debt-to-GDP ratios grow by 127% and 289%, respectively. Regardless of 
political structure or growth model, rising government indebtedness has become a structural feature of the global ﬁnancial system. And when debt 
grows faster than economic output, the costs fall most heavily on savers. Inﬂation and low real interest rates erode the value of ﬁat savings, 
transferring wealth from individual savers to the state.

Cryptomoney oﬀers an alternative to this system by separating the state from money. Throughout history, governments have altered monetary 
rules through inﬂation, capital controls, or restrictive regulations when it serves their interests. Cryptomoney places monetary governance in the 
hands of a decentralized network rather than a central authority. In doing so, it reintroduces the option of monetary choice. Savers can opt into a 
monetary asset that aligns with their priorities, needs, and wants, rather than being trapped in one that often works against their long-term ﬁnancial 
well-being. 
But choice is only meaningful if what you’re choosing has real advantages. Cryptomoney does, and its value rests on several properties that 
distinguish it from everything that came before it. The ﬁrst cornerstone of cryptomoney’s value is its predictable, rules-based monetary policy. 
These rules are not promises from an institution but properties of software run by thousands of independent participants. Changing them requires 
a broad consensus rather than the discretion of a small group, making arbitrary monetary shifts extraordinarily diﬃcult. In contrast to ﬁat systems, 
where the money supply expands in response to political and economic pressures, cryptomoney operates on rules that can’t be quietly changed 
behind closed doors, as they’re public, predictable, and enforced by consensus. 
Cryptomoney also transforms how individuals custody their wealth. In the ﬁat system, meaningful self-custody has become impractical; most

people rely on banks or other ﬁnancial intermediaries to store their savings. Even traditional non-sovereign alternatives, such as gold, typically end 
up in centralized vaults, reintroducing the same trust-based risks. In practice, this means that your assets can be delayed, restricted, or denied 
entirely if the custodian or the state decides to do so. 
 
Cryptomoney enables direct ownership, allowing individuals to hold and secure their assets without relying on custodians. As ﬁnancial 
restrictions, from bank withdrawal limits to capital controls, become more common globally, this capability becomes increasingly important. 
Finally, cryptomoney is designed for a global, digital world. It can move across borders instantly, in any amount, without institutional permission. 
This provides it with a signiﬁcant advantage over something like gold, as gold is diﬃcult to divide, verify, or transport, especially across borders. 
Cryptomoney can be sent globally in minutes, at any scale, and without reliance on a centralized intermediary. This ensures that individuals can 
move or deploy their wealth freely, regardless of their geographical location or the prevailing political environment. 
Stepping back, the case for cryptomoney is straightforward. It provides individuals with monetary choice, establishes predictable rules, eliminates 
single points of failure, and enables value to move anywhere in the world without restriction. In a system where government debt keeps climbing 
and savers absorb the consequences, the value of cryptomoney will only continue to grow. 
Bitcoin is the Leading Cryptomoney 
Bitcoin created the category of cryptomoney, so it makes sense to start there. Almost seventeen years later, BTC remains the largest and most 
widely recognized asset in the entire industry. And because money is ultimately a product of social consensus, not technical design choices, the 
real determinant of monetary status is whether the market assigns a long-lasting premium to an asset. By that measure, BTC’s position as the 
leading cryptomoney is clear.

We can see this most clearly in BTC’s performance over the past three years. From December 1, 2022, BTC has rallied by 429%, rising from 
$17,200 to $90,400. Along the way, it has set multiple new all-time highs, with the most recent one on Oct. 6, 2025 ($126,200). At the start of this 
period, BTC’s ~$318 billion market cap would have placed it well outside the ranks of the world’s largest assets. Today, its market cap stands at 
$1.81 trillion, making it the ninth most valuable asset globally. The market has not only rewarded BTC’s monetary properties with higher price 
appreciation, but has elevated it into the upper tier of global asset rankings. 
But the more telling development is how BTC has behaved compared to the rest of the crypto market. Historically, during crypto bull markets, 
Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) contracts as capital shifts further along the risk curve; however, the trend has completely reversed during this BTC 
bull run. Over the same three-year time period, BTC.D has increased from 36.6% to 57.3% (including stablecoins). BTC is diverging from the 
broader crypto market.

Of the top ﬁfteen cryptoassets from December 1, 2022, only two (XRP and SOL) have outperformed BTC, and only one, SOL, has done so in a 
meaningful way (+888% vs. BTC’s +429%). The rest of the market has lagged signiﬁcantly, with many large-cap assets barely positive or even 
negative over the same period. ETH is up just 135%, BNB 200%, and DOGE 44%, while names like POL (-85%), DOT (-59%), and ATOM 
(-77%) remain deeply underwater. What makes this even more notable is BTC’s size. As a trillion-dollar asset, it should take the most capital to 
move, yet it still outperformed nearly every major token. There is real, sustained buy pressure for BTC speciﬁcally, while most other assets are 
behaving like beta, rising only when BTC pulls the entire market upward.

A major driver of BTC’s sustained buying pressure has been the increasing adoption by institutions. The deﬁning feature of this institutional 
adoption has been the spot BTC ETFs. Demand for these vehicles has been so insatiable that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has broken 
multiple ETF records and has been lauded as the “Greatest Launch in ETF History.” IBIT reached $70 billion in AUM just 341 days after launch, 
shattering the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) ETF’s previous record by 1,350 days.

Momentum from the 2024 ETF launches carried directly into 2025, with total ETF AUM rising 20% year-to-date, from roughly 1.1 million BTC 
to 1.32 million BTC. At current prices, that represents more than $120 billion worth of BTC held through these products and accounts for over 6% 
of BTC’s maximum supply. Rather than fading after the initial launch hype, ETF demand has become a continuous source of buying pressure, 
accumulating BTC regardless of market conditions.

Furthermore, institutional participation has extended far beyond ETFs. Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) emerged as major buyers throughout 2025, 
further reinforcing BTC’s role as a treasury reserve asset. While Michael Saylor’s Strategy has long been the most visible example of corporate 
accumulation, there are now nearly 200 companies globally holding BTC on their balance sheets. Publicly traded ﬁrms alone own roughly 1.06 
million BTC, about 5% of the total supply, with Strategy accounting for 650,000, the largest share by a wide margin. 
Perhaps the most important development in 2025 that separated BTC from the rest of the crypto market was the establishment of the Strategic 
Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). The SBR formally recognized a distinction that markets already made between BTC and the rest of the crypto market, 
treating BTC as a strategic monetary commodity while placing all other digital assets into a separate stockpile for standard stewardship. In its 
announcement, the White House described BTC as a “unique store of value in the global ﬁnancial system” and likened it to “digital gold.” Lastly, 
and perhaps most importantly, the order directs the Treasury to develop strategies for acquiring additional BTC in the future. While no such 
purchases have occurred yet, the optionality alone signals that federal policy is now considering BTC in forward-looking, reserve-asset terms. If 
executed, such an acquisition program would further cement Bitcoin’s monetary status not just among cryptoassets, but all assets.

Is BTC Good Money? 
Although BTC has solidiﬁed its lead over other forms of cryptomoney, 2025 raised a fresh set of questions about its monetary properties. As the 
largest non-sovereign monetary asset, gold remains BTC’s most important benchmark. With geopolitical tensions rising and expectations of future 
monetary easing increasing, gold posted one of its strongest annual performances in decades. BTC, however, did not follow. 
 
While the BTC/XAU ratio brieﬂy hit new all-time highs in December 2024, it has since retraced by roughly 50%. That retracement is notable 
because it occurred as gold surged to new all-time highs against the U.S. Dollar. Year-to-date, gold is up over 60% to $4,150 per troy ounce. With 
gold’s total market value approaching $30 trillion and BTC still representing only a fraction of that, the divergence raises a reasonable question: 
How strong is BTC’s “digital gold” status if it is not keeping pace with gold during one of gold’s strongest cycles?

If Bitcoin is not trading in line with gold, the next place to look is how it behaved relative to traditional risk assets. Historically, BTC has exhibited 
periods of correlation with equity benchmarks, including SPY and QQQ. For example, from April 2020 to April 2025, BTC had a relatively 
strong average 90-day correlation with SPY of 0.52, and a relatively weak correlation with gold (0.18). Because of this, if equities were 
weakening, BTC’s lag relative to gold might be understandable.

## Page 17

16 
 
But that is not the case. Year-to-date, XAU is up 60%, SPY is up 17.6%, and QQQ is up 21.6%, while BTC is down 2.9%. Considering that BTC 
is a much smaller and more volatile asset than gold and major equity indices, 2025’s underperformance relative to these benchmarks raises 
reasonable questions about its monetary narrative. With gold and equities pushing to new all-time highs, one might expect BTC to exhibit similar 
behavior, especially given its historical correlations. Yet, that is not the case. Why? 
First, it’s worth noting that this underperformance is a recent development rather than a yearlong theme. As recently as Aug. 14, 2025, BTC had 
posted higher year-to-date returns than XAU, SPY, and QQQ on an absolute basis. Its relative weakness did not begin to take shape until October. 
What stands out is not how long the underperformance has lasted, but how severe it has been. 
While several factors may have contributed to this severity, we believe the most important driver of BTC’s muted performance is the behavior of 
older, large-balance holders. As BTC has become increasingly institutionalized over the past two years, its liquidity proﬁle has changed 
meaningfully. Deep, regulated markets, especially through ETFs, now allow large holders to sell without imposing the kind of market impact that 
would have been unavoidable in earlier cycles. For many of these holders, this created the ﬁrst real opportunity to take proﬁts.

There is both ample anecdotal and onchain evidence to suggest that some long-dormant holders have taken this opportunity to reduce exposure. 
Earlier this year, Galaxy Digital facilitated the sale of 80,000 BTC from a “Satoshi-era investor.” This single transaction represented 0.38% of 
Bitcoin’s total supply and originated from a single entity.

Bitcoin onchain metrics tell a similar story. Some of the largest and longest-standing holders, addresses holding between 1,000 and 100,000 BTC, 
have been net distributors throughout 2025. These addresses held 6.9 million BTC at the start of the year, almost one-third of all BTC in existence, 
and have been consistent sellers throughout the year. The 1,000-10,000 BTC cohort has seen net outﬂows of 417,300 BTC (-9% YTD), and the 
10,000-100,000 BTC cohort has recorded an additional 51,700 BTC in outﬂows (-2% YTD). 
As Bitcoin becomes more institutionalized and a greater share of ﬂows migrates oﬀchain, the informational value of onchain metrics will naturally 
diminish. Even so, taken together with anecdotal evidence such as the Satoshi-era sale, the data provide a reasonable basis to conclude that early, 
large holders have been net sellers in 2025, particularly in the second half of the year.

## Page 20

This wave of supply has also coincided with a meaningful slowdown in the buying ﬂows that have been the predominant drivers of BTC price 
appreciation over the past two years. Inﬂows from DATs dropped sharply in October, marking the ﬁrst month in 2025 in which DATs did not 
record net inﬂows of more than $1 billion. On the other hand, the spot ETFs, which had been consistent net buyers throughout the year, have been 
net sellers since October. With the two largest sources of steady BTC demand, DATs and ETFs, appearing exhausted for the moment, the market 
has had to absorb both declining inﬂows and increased distribution from older holders simultaneously. 
With all that, is there cause for concern? Has BTC’s moneyness been invalidated by the recent underperformance? In our opinion, the answer is 
no. As the saying goes, “when in doubt, zoom out.” It is hard to dismiss BTC solely due to a three-month stretch of weakness, especially when 
BTC has underperformed for far longer periods in the past, only to rebound and set new all-time highs against both USD and gold. While this 
underperformance is a setback for the time being, we do not view it as a structural issue. 
Looking ahead to 2026 is a diﬀerent challenge. As BTC becomes increasingly treated as a macro asset, legacy frameworks, such as the four-year 
cycle, matter less than they once did. BTC’s performance will be shaped by broader macro forces, which means the relevant questions become: 
Do central banks continue to accumulate gold? Does the AI-driven equity trade keep accelerating? Will Trump ﬁre Powell? If so, will Trump force

the new Fed chair to start buying BTC? These are diﬃcult variables to forecast, and we make no claim to know their outcomes. 
What we are conﬁdent in, however, is BTC’s long-term monetary trajectory. Over multi-year and multi-decade time horizons, we expect BTC to 
continue appreciating in monetary terms, against both USD and gold. Holding this view ultimately comes down to a simple question: “Is 
cryptomoney a superior form of money?” If the answer is yes, then the long-run direction of BTC becomes clear. 
Beyond BTC: What about the L1s? 
BTC has clearly established itself as the leading cryptomoney, but it is not the only cryptoasset with a monetary premium. Several Layer-1 (L1) 
tokens also trade with valuations that reﬂect some degree of monetary premium, or expectations that they may develop one over time. 
 
The total crypto market cap sits at $3.26 trillion. BTC accounts for $1.80 trillion of that, and of the remaining $1.45 trillion, roughly $0.83 trillion 
is concentrated in alternative L1s. Taken together, about $2.63 trillion, roughly 81% of all capital in crypto, is allocated to assets the market either 
already treats as money or believes could accrue a monetary premium.

Given that, whether you’re a trader, investor, capital allocator, or builder, understanding how the market assigns and withdraws monetary premium 
is essential. Nothing in crypto moves valuations more than the market’s willingness (or unwillingness) to treat an asset as money. For that reason, 
forecasting where monetary premiums will accrue in the future is arguably the single most important input to portfolio construction in this 
industry. 
As mentioned earlier, we anticipate that BTC will continue to capture market share from gold and other non-sovereign stores of wealth in the 
coming years. But where does that leave L1s? Does a rising tide lift all boats, or does BTC partly make up the ground on gold by pulling monetary 
premium away from alternative L1s? 
 
First, it’s helpful to look at where L1 valuations stand today. The top four L1s, ETH ($361.15 billion), XRP ($130.11 billion), BNB ($120.64 
billion), and SOL ($74.68 billion), combine for a market cap of $686.58 billion, accounting for 83% of the alternative L1 segment. After the top 
four, valuations drop oﬀ quickly (TRX sits at $26.67 billion), but they remain material. AVAX, the ﬁfteenth-largest L1, still commands a valuation 
north of $5 billion. 
Importantly, L1 market caps are not a pure reﬂection of an implied monetary premium. There are three main L1 valuation frameworks: (i) 
               
 


---

## Page 23

22 
Monetary Premium, (ii) Real Economic Value (REV), and (iii) Demand for Economic Security, so a project’s market cap is not solely the result of 
the market treating it as money. 
 
Despite these competing valuation frameworks, the market is increasingly valuing L1s through a monetary-premium lens rather than a 
revenue-driven one. Over the past few years, the collective price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of all L1s with a market cap above $1 billion has been slowly 
increasing from 200x to 400x. However, this headline number is misleading because it includes TRON and Hyperliquid. Over the last 30 days, 
TRX and HYPE generated 51% of the revenue in this group but account for only 4% of the market cap. 
Once you remove those two outliers, the real story becomes clear: L1 valuations have been rising even as revenues have been falling. The adjusted 
P/S ratio has consistently trended higher: 
● Nov. 30, 2021 - 40x 
● Nov. 30, 2022 - 212x 
● Nov. 30, 2023 - 137x 
               
 


---

## Page 24

23 
● Nov. 30, 2024 - 205x 
● Nov. 30, 2025 - 536x 
A REV-based interpretation would argue that the market is simply pricing in future revenue growth, but this explanation falls apart under basic 
scrutiny. Among this same basket of L1s (still excluding TRON and Hyperliquid), revenues have declined in every year except one: 
● 2021 - $12.33 billion 
● 2022 - $4.89 billion (down 60% YoY) 
● 2023 - $2.72 billion (down 44% YoY) 
● 2024 - $3.55 billion (up 31% YoY) 
● 2025 - $1.70 billion annualized (down 52% YoY) 
In our view, the simplest and most straightforward explanation is that these valuations are being driven by monetary premiums, rather than by 
current or future revenues. 
 
Diving deeper into SOL’s outperformance, it appears that it may have underperformed relative to its ecosystem growth. Over the same period that

## Page 25

24 
SOL outperformed BTC by 87%, Solana’s fundamentals went parabolic. DeFi TVL increased by 2,988%, fees by 1,983%, and DEX volume by 
3,301%. By any reasonable measure, Solana’s ecosystem has grown anywhere from 20x to 30x since December 1, 2022. Yet SOL, the asset meant 
to capture that growth, only managed to outperform BTC by 87%. 
Read that again. 
To generate meaningful outperformance against BTC, an L1 didn’t need its ecosystem to grow by 200-300%. It needed 2,000-3,000% growth just 
to produce high-double-digit outperformance. 
Based on all the above, we believe that while L1s are still being valued on the hope of future monetary premiums, the market’s conﬁdence in those 
expectations is quietly eroding. Meanwhile, the market is not losing faith in BTC’s monetary premium, and if anything, BTC’s lead is widening. 
And while cryptomoney doesn’t technically need fees or revenue to justify its valuation, those metrics do matter for L1s. Unlike BTC, their 
narrative depends on building ecosystems (applications, users, throughput, economic activity, etc.) that supposedly support the token. However, if 
an L1’s ecosystem is showing year-over-year declines in usage, partly reﬂected in falling fees and revenue, then that token loses the one 
competitive advantage it had over BTC. Without real economic growth, the cryptomoney story for these L1s becomes increasingly diﬃcult for the 
market to believe. 
Going forward, we don’t expect this trend to reverse in 2026 or in the years to come. With a few possible exceptions, we expect alternative L1s to 
continue losing market share to BTC. Their valuations, driven largely by expectations of a future monetary premium, will steadily compress as the 
market increasingly recognizes that BTC has the strongest claim to cryptomoney of them all. While Bitcoin will face challenges in the years 
ahead, those issues are too far out and too dependent on unknown variables to oﬀer meaningful support to the monetary premiums of competing 
L1 assets today. For L1s, the burden of proof has shifted. Their narratives are no longer compelling when set against BTC, and they can’t rely on 
broad market euphoria to justify their valuations indeﬁnitely. 
Devil’s Advocate: The Case for L1s against BTC 
Even though we do not expect L1s to outperform BTC in the near term, it would be a mistake to assume their monetary premiums must converge 
to zero. Markets rarely assign multi-hundred-billion-dollar valuations to assets without some underlying rationale, and the persistence of these 
valuations suggests that investors believe certain L1s may retain an enduring role within the broader cryptomoney landscape. In other words, 
while BTC has clearly separated itself as the dominant monetary asset in crypto, the possibility remains that some L1s could carve out their own 
long-term monetary niches, particularly if Bitcoin fails to address several structural challenges that lie further out on the horizon. 
Quantum Threat 
The most pressing threat to BTC’s monetary status is the “quantum threat.” If quantum computers become powerful enough, they could break 
Bitcoin’s elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA), allowing an attacker to derive private keys from public keys. In theory, this would

jeopardize any address whose public key has been exposed onchain, including reused addresses and old UTXOs that were created before best 
practices were widely adopted. 
According to Nic Carter, approximately 4.8 million BTC (23% of the supply) reside in exposed addresses that would be vulnerable to a theoretical 
quantum attack. Of that amount, 1.7 million BTC (8% of supply) reside in legacy p2pk addresses that are almost certainly “dead coins,” coins 
whose owners are no longer alive, active, or in possession of their keys. These coins represent the biggest unresolved dilemma. 
If quantum computing ever becomes a credible risk, Bitcoin will need to introduce support for quantum-resistant signature schemes. Without such 
a transition, BTC’s monetary value would collapse, and the old maxim would ﬂip into “your keys, not your coins.” Thus, we ﬁnd it very unlikely 
that the Bitcoin network won’t upgrade to address the quantum threat. However, the real issue is not upgrading Bitcoin, but what to do with the 
“dead coins.” Even if a new quantum-resistant address format is introduced, these coins will likely remain vulnerable forever. 
These are the two most commonly discussed approaches: 
● Do nothing. Eventually, anyone with quantum capabilities could seize these coins and reintroduce up to 8% of the supply into circulation, 
likely to holders who never owned them. This would almost certainly depress the price of BTC and undermine monetary conﬁdence. 
● Burn the coins. After a predetermined block height, vulnerable coins could be rendered unspendable and eﬀectively removed from the 
supply. But this approach introduces its own trade-oﬀs as it violates Bitcoin’s norm of censorship resistance, and risks setting a precedent 
that coins can be “voted” out of existence. 
Thankfully, quantum computing is unlikely to pose an immediate threat to Bitcoin. Estimates vary widely, but even aggressive projections place 
the earliest plausible risk window around 2030. Given this timeline, we expect little to no meaningful progress on the quantum issue in 2026. It 
remains a long-term governance challenge rather than an urgent engineering problem. 
What happens beyond that horizon is harder to predict. The biggest unresolved question is how the network will handle the dead coins that cannot 
migrate to a quantum-resistant address format. We do not know which path Bitcoin will ultimately take, but we are conﬁdent that the network will 
make whatever choices are necessary to preserve, and maximize, the monetary value of BTC. 
Both of the major options have a credible claim to that goal. The ﬁrst, doing nothing, upholds Bitcoin’s censorship resistance at the cost of 
introducing new supply that the market must absorb. The second, burning the coins, raises questions about Bitcoin’s censorship resistance, but 
prevents BTC from potentially falling into the hands of illicit actors. 
Regardless of which approach Bitcoin ultimately takes, the quantum issue represents a genuine long-term governance challenge. If quantum 
computing becomes a credible threat and Bitcoin fails to upgrade, BTC’s monetary status collapses. And if that failure were to occur, it would 
create a realistic opening for an alternative cryptomoney with a stronger quantum-resistance path to capture BTC’s ﬂeeting monetary premium. 
Lack of Programmability 
One limitation of the Bitcoin network is its lack of general-purpose programmability. Bitcoin is intentionally not Turing-complete; its scripting

## Page 27

26 
language is limited by design, which restricts the complexity of onchain transaction logic. Unlike in other ecosystems where smart contracts can 
natively verify and enforce signature conditions, Bitcoin cannot yet validate external messages or coordinate trust-minimized bridging without 
oﬀchain infrastructure. Because of this, entire categories of applications, such as DEXs, onchain derivatives, and privacy tools, are nearly 
impossible to build on the Bitcoin L1. 
 
Although some proponents argue that this design reduces the attack surface and preserves Bitcoin’s monetary simplicity, there is undoubtedly a 
segment of BTC holders who want access to programmable environments. As of writing, 370,300 BTC (equivalent to $33.64 billion) have been 
bridged to other networks. Of this amount, 365,000 BTC (roughly 99% of all bridged BTC) is secured through custodial solutions or solutions that 
introduce trust-based assumptions. In other words, for BTC to be used productively in more expressive ecosystems, users have reintroduced the 
same set of risks that Bitcoin was originally designed to eliminate. 
Attempts to solve this problem within the Bitcoin ecosystem, through federated sidechains, early L2s, and trust-minimized multisigs, have not 
meaningfully reduced the reliance on meaningful trust assumptions. Users want to deploy BTC in expressive environments, but in the absence of a

trustless way to move BTC between chains, they default to centralized custodians. 
As BTC continues to grow and function more like a macro asset, demand for ways to use BTC productively will only increase. Whether it’s 
posting BTC as collateral, borrowing against it, swapping into other assets, or interacting with more expressive and programmable ﬁnancial 
systems, users naturally want to do more with their money than simply hold it. Under Bitcoin’s current design, these use cases introduce 
signiﬁcant long-tail risk as it is eﬀectively impossible to use BTC in a programmable or leveraged context without handing custody to a 
centralized intermediary. 
For these reasons, we believe that it will be necessary for the Bitcoin network to fork to enable these use cases to take place in a trustless 
and permissionless manner. While we don’t think this materializes through the Bitcoin network becoming a smart contract platform, we believe 
it makes the most sense to introduce an opcode, such as OP_CAT, that can enable trustless BTC bridging. 
OP_CAT is appealing because it represents a small consensus change that can unlock trustless BTC movement between chains. It is not a step 
toward turning Bitcoin into a smart-contract platform, but rather a simple opcode that, when combined with Taproot and existing Script primitives, 
allows Bitcoin to enforce spending conditions directly on the base layer. This capability would enable trustless BTC bridges without relying on 
custodians, federations, or external validator sets, addressing the core risk that has led to hundreds of thousands of BTC being held in custodial 
wrappers today. 
Unlike the quantum threat, Bitcoin’s lack of programmability is not an existential risk to BTC’s moneyness. What it does limit, however, is the 
total addressable market for BTC as cryptomoney. The demand for programmable money is already visible as more than 370,000 BTC (1.76% of 
total supply) sit in bridged environments, and over $120 billion in assets are deployed across DeFi. That demand is only going to increase as 
crypto proliferates and more and more ﬁnancial activity moves onchain. Bitcoin simply doesn’t oﬀer a trustless path to use BTC inside 
programmable ecosystems today, and if the market deems those risks unacceptable, then programmable L1 assets like ETH and SOL will be the 
ones to capture that demand. 
Security Budget 
The last structural concern for Bitcoin is its security budget. This issue has been discussed for over a decade, and while opinions vary widely on 
its severity, it remains one of the most contested long-term questions regarding Bitcoin’s monetary integrity. At its core, the security budget refers 
to the total amount of compensation miners receive for securing the network, which is currently a combination of block subsidies and transaction 
fees. As block rewards continue to halve every four years, Bitcoin must eventually rely primarily, and then solely, on fees to incentivize miners to 
protect the chain.

## Page 29

For a time, amidst the surging popularity of ordinals and runes, it appeared that perhaps transaction fees alone could potentially be enough to 
compensate miners to secure the chain. In April 2024, Bitcoin generated $281.4 million in chain fees, its second-highest monthly total ever. Now, 
more than a year and a half later, fee revenue has fallen oﬀ a cliﬀ. In fact, there was only $4.87 million in chain fees in November, the lowest 
monthly total since December 2019. 
Although the dropoﬀ in fees is startling, it may not be a cause for immediate concern. Bitcoin’s block subsidy still provides a meaningful incentive 
for miners, and this will remain true for the next few decades. Even as late as 2050, the network will emit roughly 50 BTC per week, a non-trivial 
amount of issuance for miners to compete for. As long as subsidies dominate miner revenue, the chain’s security is unlikely to be at risk. 
Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly unlikely that chain fees will be able to replace current block subsidies entirely. 
That said, the security budget debate is more nuanced than simply asking whether fees will fully replace today’s block subsidies. Fees don’t need 
to equal the full subsidy; they only need to exceed the cost of a credible attack, an amount that is inherently unknowable and may change 
dramatically as mining technology and energy markets evolve. A future where mining costs fall signiﬁcantly would also lower the required fee 
ﬂoor. This could play out across a wide range of scenarios. In the moderate case, incremental ASIC improvements and cheaper access to stranded

renewables reduce miners’ marginal costs. In the extreme case, breakthroughs in energy production, such as commercial fusion or ultra-low-cost 
nuclear, could push electricity prices down by orders of magnitude, dramatically altering the economics of sustaining hashpower. 
Even acknowledging that there are too many unknown variables to calculate what Bitcoin’s security budget “needs” to be, it is still worth 
considering the hypothetical in which miner rewards eventually fall short of what is required to economically guarantee the network’s security. In 
that scenario, the incentives that underpin Bitcoin’s credible neutrality begin to break down, and the chain’s guarantees would rely increasingly on 
social expectations rather than enforceable economic constraints. 
One possibility is that certain actors, exchanges, custodians, nation-states, or large holders would mine at a loss to protect the asset they rely on. 
However, while defensive mining may preserve the chain, it may also weaken the social consensus on BTC’s moneyness. If users come to believe 
that BTC relies on coordinated support from large actors, its monetary neutrality, and therefore its monetary premium, could come under pressure. 
It’s also entirely possible that no entities step up to defend Bitcoin at an economic loss. In that scenario, Bitcoin could become susceptible to a 
51% attack. Although a 51% attack wouldn’t permanently destroy Bitcoin (Proof-of-Work chains such as Ethereum Classic and Monero have 
survived 51% attacks), it would unquestionably call Bitcoin’s safety into doubt. 
With so many unknowns shaping Bitcoin’s long-term security budget, no one can say with conﬁdence how the system will evolve decades from 
now. While this uncertainty poses no present risk to BTC, it does create a long-tail outcome the market must price. In that sense, the residual 
monetary premium on some L1s can be viewed as a hedge against the remote possibility that Bitcoin’s economic security becomes challenged 
over time. 
The ETH Debate: Is it Cryptomoney? 
Of all the major assets in crypto, none has sparked more sustained debate than ETH. BTC’s role as the dominant cryptomoney is broadly 
uncontested, but ETH’s role is anything but settled. To some, ETH is the only credible non-sovereign monetary asset besides BTC; to others, it 
represents a business with declining revenues, tightening margins, and relentless competition from faster, cheaper L1s.

This debate seemingly reached its climax in the ﬁrst half of this year. In March, XRP brieﬂy surpassed ETH in fully diluted valuation (Notably, 
ETH is fully circulating, whereas only ~60% of XRP’s supply is circulating). 
On March 16, ETH’s FDV stood at $227.65 billion, while XRP’s reached $239.23 billion, an outcome that virtually no one would have considered 
possible a year earlier. Then, on April 8, 2025, the ETH/BTC ratio fell below 0.02 for the ﬁrst time since February 2020. In other words, the 
entirety of ETH’s outperformance against BTC from the last cycle had fully unwound. By that point, sentiment around ETH had deteriorated to its 
lowest level in years.

To make matters worse, price action was only part of the story. Ethereum’s share of L1 fees has declined steadily as rival ecosystems strengthened. 
Solana reestablished itself in 2024, Hyperliquid broke out in 2025, and together they pushed Ethereum’s fee share down to 17%, fourth among L1s 
and a dramatic fall from the top spot it held just a year earlier. Fees aren’t everything, but they are a clear signal of where economic activity is 
migrating, and the competitive landscape Ethereum faces today is the ﬁercest in its history.

Yet history shows that crypto’s most signiﬁcant reversals often begin when sentiment is at its bleakest. By the time ETH was being written oﬀ as a 
failed asset, most of its perceived “failures” had already been priced in. 
In May 2025, the ﬁrst real signs emerged that the market had become too pessimistic. Both ETH/BTC and ETH’s USD price began to reverse 
sharply during this period. The ETH/BTC ratio climbed from a low of 0.017 in April to 0.042 in August, a 139% move, while ETH itself rose 
191% over the same stretch, from $1,646 to $4,793. That momentum ultimately culminated in a new all-time high on August 24, when ETH 
reached $4,946. 
Following this repricing, it became clear that ETH’s broader trajectory had shifted toward renewed strength. Leadership changes at the Ethereum 
Foundation (discussed later) and the arrival of ETH-focused Digital Asset Treasuries brought a degree of conviction that had been absent for much 
of the prior year.

Prior to this rally, the contrast between BTC and ETH was nowhere more visible than in their respective ETF markets. When spot ETH ETFs 
launched in July 2024, ﬂows were anemic. Over their ﬁrst six months, they pulled in just $2.41 billion, an underwhelming ﬁgure when set against 
BTC’s record-breaking ETF performance. 
However, concerns over ETF ﬂows completely reversed alongside ETH’s revival. Over the year, spot ETH ETFs pulled in $9.72 billion, compared 
to $21.78 billion for BTC. Given that BTC’s market cap is nearly ﬁve times larger, the diﬀerence in ﬂows, being only 2.2x, was far narrower than 
many expected. Put diﬀerently, once adjusted for market cap, ETH saw more ETF demand than BTC, a sharp reversal from the narrative that 
institutions had no real appetite for ETH. In some instances, ETH outpaced BTC outright. From May 26 to August 25, ETH ETFs pulled in 
$10.20 billion, more than BTC’s $9.79 billion over the same period, marking the ﬁrst time institutional demand clearly tilted toward ETH.

When viewed by ETF issuers, BlackRock extended its dominance in the ETF market, ﬁnishing 2025 with 3.7 million ETH, representing 60% of 
the total spot ETH ETF market share. That ﬁgure was up from 1.1 million ETH at the end of 2024, a 241% increase, outpacing all other issuers in 
yearly growth. Overall, spot ETH ETFs ended the year with 6.2 million ETH, or about 5% of the total ETH supply.

Underneath ETH’s sharp recovery, the most important development was the rise of ETH-focused Digital Asset Treasuries. DATs created a steady, 
recurring source of demand that ETH had never seen before, anchoring the asset in a way that narratives or speculative ﬂows could not. If ETH’s 
price action marked the visible turning point, DAT accumulation was the deeper structural shift that made it possible. 
The DATs had a signiﬁcant impact on the price of ETH, accumulating a total of 4.8 million ETH, 4% of the total ETH supply, over the course of 
2025. The most proliﬁc of the ETH DATs was Tom Lee’s Bitmine (BMNR), a former Bitcoin mining company that began converting its treasury 
and capital to ETH in July 2025. Between July and November, Bitmine purchased 3.63 million ETH, making it the clear leader in the DAT market 
share with 75% of all DAT holdings. 
As powerful as ETH’s reversal was, the rally eventually cooled. By November 30, ETH had pulled back from its August highs to $2,991, 
signiﬁcantly below even last cycle’s prior all-time high of $4,878. ETH is in a far stronger position than it was in April, but the recovery has not 
erased the structural concerns that sparked the bear case in the ﬁrst place. If anything, the ETH debate has returned stronger than ever. 
On one side, ETH is displaying many of the same markers BTC exhibited during its own ascent to monetary status. ETF inﬂows are no longer 
anemic. Digital Asset Treasuries have emerged as a persistent source of demand. And, perhaps most importantly, an increasingly visible share of

the market is treating ETH as something categorically diﬀerent from other L1 tokens, an asset that a subset of the market now treats as part of the 
same monetary framework as BTC. 
However, the concerns that dragged ETH down earlier this year have yet to be alleviated. Ethereum’s core fundamentals have not fully recovered. 
Its share of L1 fees continues to face pressure from credible competitors, such as Solana and Hyperliquid. Activity on the base layer remains far 
below prior-cycle peaks. And despite ETH’s sharp rebound, BTC still sits comfortably above its previous all-time highs while ETH remains below 
them. Even during ETH’s strongest months, a signiﬁcant portion of holders used the rally as exit liquidity rather than as conﬁrmation of a 
long-term monetary thesis. 
The fundamental question at the center of this debate is not whether Ethereum is valuable, but rather how ETH, the asset, accrues value 
from Ethereum. 
Last cycle, a common assumption was that ETH would directly accrue value from the success of Ethereum. This is a key part of the “Ultrasound 
Money” argument: Ethereum would be so useful that it would burn vast quantities of ETH, rendering the asset a deﬂationary source of value. 
 
Now, we think we can say with considerable conﬁdence that this will not be the case. Ethereum’s fees have plummeted with no recovery in sight,

and its largest sources of growth, RWAs and institutions, primarily use USD as the base monetary asset, not ETH. 
The value of ETH will now depend on how ETH indirectly accrues value from Ethereum’s success. But indirect accrual is far less certain. It rests 
on the hope that as Ethereum becomes more systemically important, more users and capital will choose to treat ETH as cryptomoney and a store 
of value. 
But unlike direct, mechanical value accrual, there is no guarantee this happens. It relies entirely on social preference and collective belief, which 
isn’t inherently a ﬂaw (There’s a whole section prior to this explaining how BTC accrues value in this way). But, it does mean that ETH’s 
appreciation is no longer tied to Ethereum’s economic activity in a deterministic way. 
 
All of this brings the ETH debate back to its core tension. ETH may, in fact, be accruing a monetary premium, but that premium has remained 
downstream from BTC’s. The market is once again treating ETH as a levered expression of BTC’s monetary thesis, not as an independent 
monetary asset. ETH’s 90-day rolling correlation with BTC has hovered between 0.7 and 0.9 throughout 2025, while its rolling beta surged to 
multi-year highs, at times exceeding 1.8. ETH is now moving more aggressively than BTC, but has remained dependent on BTC.

## Page 39

38 
This is a subtle, but extremely important distinction. ETH’s monetary relevance today exists because BTC’s monetary narrative remains intact. As 
long as the market believes in BTC as a non-sovereign store of value, there will be a marginal cohort of market participants willing to extend that 
belief to ETH. And if BTC continues to strengthen in 2026, ETH has a simple path to make up even more ground. 
 
Ethereum DATs are still early in their life cycle and, to date, have primarily facilitated ETH accumulation through common equity issuance. In a 
renewed crypto bull market, however, these entities could explore additional capital formation strategies similar to those Strategy has used to 
expand its BTC exposure, including convertible notes and preferred stock. 
For example, a DAT such as BitMine could raise a mix of low-coupon convertible debt and higher-yield preferred capital, deploy the proceeds 
directly into ETH purchases, and stake that ETH to generate recurring yield. Under reasonable assumptions, staking income could partially oﬀset 
ﬁxed interest and dividend obligations, allowing the treasury to continue accumulating ETH while increasing balance sheet leverage during 
favorable market conditions. This potential “second life” of the Ethereum DATs could serve as an additional force sustaining ETH’s higher beta to 
BTC in 2026, assuming a broader BTC bull market resumes.

Ultimately, the market continues to price ETH’s monetary premium as contingent on BTC’s. ETH is not yet an autonomous monetary asset with 
an independent macro foundation; rather, it is a growing secondary beneﬁciary of BTC’s monetary consensus. Its recent resurgence reﬂects a 
marginal cohort of believers willing to treat ETH more like BTC and less like a typical L1 token. Still, even amidst relative strength, the market’s 
belief in ETH is inseparable from the continued strength of BTC’s own narrative. 
In short, ETH’s monetary story is no longer broken, but neither is it settled. Under the existing market structure and in light of ETH’s heightened 
beta relative to BTC, ETH can appreciate meaningfully if BTC’s thesis continues to play out, and structural demand from DATs and corporate 
treasuries gives it real upside in that scenario. But, ultimately, ETH’s monetary trajectory still depends on BTC for the foreseeable future. Until 
ETH exhibits lower correlation and beta to BTC, something it has never done on a longer time frame, ETH’s premium will ﬂuctuate in the shadow 
of BTC. 
Zcash: A Hedge Against BTC? 
Among all the cryptoassets outside BTC and ETH, ZEC’s monetary perception shifted the most signiﬁcantly in 2025. For years, ZEC sat outside 
the cryptomoney hierarchy, viewed as a niche privacy coin rather than a monetary asset. However, as concerns surrounding surveillance and the 
institutionalization of Bitcoin accelerated, privacy resurfaced as a core monetary property, rather than a niche ideological preference. 
Bitcoin has proven that non-sovereign digital money can function at a global scale, but it failed to preserve the privacy that we have become 
accustomed to using physical cash. Every transaction is broadcast on a transparent public ledger that anyone with a block explorer can monitor. It 
is a bitter irony that a tool designed to subvert the state inadvertently created a ﬁnancial panopticon. 
Zcash combines Bitcoin’s monetary policy with the privacy properties of physical cash via zero-knowledge cryptography. No digital asset can 
oﬀer the same battle-tested and deterministic privacy guarantees as the latest Zcash shielded pool, making it a valuable form of private money that 
cannot be easily replicated. In our view, the market re-rated ZEC relative to BTC to reﬂect its status as an aspirational private 
cryptomoney, positioning ZEC as a hedge against the rise of the surveillance state and the institutionalization of Bitcoin.

## Page 41

Year-to-date ZEC surged 666% against BTC, pushing its market cap to $7.0 billion and brieﬂy surpassing XMR as the most valuable privacy coin 
by market cap. This relative strength signals that ZEC is being priced as a viable form of private cryptomoney alongside XMR. 
Privacy on Bitcoin 
Bitcoin is very unlikely to adopt a shielded pool architecture, rendering the notion that it will eventually absorb Zcash’s value proposition 
unfounded. Bitcoin is known for its conservative culture, which prioritizes ossiﬁcation to reduce attack surfaces and maintain monetary integrity. 
Embedding privacy at the protocol level would necessitate changes to Bitcoin’s core architecture, introducing the risk of an inﬂation bug that 
could harm its monetary integrity. Zcash is willing to take this risk as privacy is its main value proposition. 
Implementing zero-knowledge cryptography at the base layer would also reduce the scalability of the blockchain as it would necessitate the use of 
nulliﬁers and hashed notes to prevent double-spending, which raises long-term concerns about “state bloat.” Nulliﬁers create an append-only “list” 
that grows indeﬁnitely, potentially resulting in a scenario where running a node would be resource-intensive. Forcing nodes to store a massive, 
ever-growing nulliﬁer set would harm Bitcoin’s decentralization, as it would increase the requirements to run a node on the network over time.

As mentioned earlier, absent a soft fork that enables ZK veriﬁcation, such as OP_CAT, no Bitcoin L2 can inherit Bitcoin’s security while 
delivering Zcash-level privacy. You either introduce trusted intermediaries (federations), accept long and interactive withdrawal delays (BitVM 
model), or push execution and security to a separate system entirely (sovereign rollups). Unless that changes, there is simply no existing path to 
achieve Bitcoin’s security with Zcash’s privacy, positioning ZEC as a valuable form of private cryptomoney. 
A Hedge Against CBDCs 
The urgency for privacy is compounded by the arrival of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Half the countries in the world are either 
investigating or have implemented a CBDC. CBDCs are programmable, meaning issuers can not only track every transaction but also control how, 
when, and where funds are spent. Funds could be programmed to work only at approved merchants or within speciﬁc geographies. 
 
While this may sound like a dystopian fantasy, the weaponization of the banking system is grounded in reality: 
● Nigeria (2020): During the #EndSARS protests against police brutality, the Central Bank of Nigeria froze the bank accounts of prominent 
protest organizers and feminist groups, forcing the movement to rely on crypto to sustain itself.

## Page 43

42 
● United States of America (2020-2025): Regulators and the largest banks have debanked lawful but politically disfavored sectors on the 
basis of “reputation risk” and ideology rather than safety and soundness, a pattern serious enough that the White House ordered a review 
and the OCC’s 2025 debanking study documented systematic restrictions on legal industries ranging from oil and gas to ﬁrearms, adult 
content, and crypto. 
● Canada (2022): During the Freedom Convoy protests, the Canadian government invoked the Emergencies Act to freeze the bank and 
crypto accounts of protesters and even small-dollar donors without a court order. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police even blacklisted 34 
self-custody crypto wallet addresses, ordering all regulated exchanges to cease facilitating transactions with them. This proved that Western 
democracies are willing to weaponize the ﬁnancial system against political dissent. 
In an era where money can be programmed to control you, ZEC oﬀers a deﬁnitive opt-out. However, Zcash isn't just for escaping CBDCs; it is 
becoming increasingly necessary to protect Bitcoin itself. 
A Hedge Against Bitcoin's Capture 
As inﬂuential advocates like Naval Ravikant and Balaji Srinivasan have argued, Zcash is an insurance policy for maintaining Bitcoin’s vision of 
ﬁnancial freedom. 
Bitcoin is rapidly consolidating under centralized entities. Between centralized exchanges (3.0 million BTC), ETFs (1.3 million BTC), and 
publicly traded companies (829,192 BTC), approximately 5.1 million BTC (24% of total supply) is currently held by third parties.

## Page 44

This concentration implies that 24% of the total BTC supply is vulnerable to regulatory seizure, mirroring the centralized conditions that enabled 
the U.S. Government’s conﬁscation of gold in 1933. Executive Order 6102 legally forced U.S. citizens to surrender all gold holdings above $100 
to the Federal Reserve. In exchange, they received paper currency at the oﬃcial rate of $20.67 per troy ounce. It was enforced through banking 
choke points rather than physical force. 
For Bitcoin, the mechanism would be identical. Regulators do not need your private keys to seize 24% of the supply; they only need legal 
authority over the custodians. In this scenario, the government issues an enforcement order to entities like BlackRock and Coinbase. Legally 
bound to comply, these companies would be forced to freeze and transfer the BTC they hold. Overnight, nearly a quarter of the BTC supply could 
be eﬀectively nationalized without a single line of code being broken. While this is certainly an edge case, it cannot be entirely ruled out. 
Given the blockchain’s transparency, it also means that self-custody is no longer a viable standalone defense. Any BTC withdrawn from a KYC’d 
exchange or brokerage account is susceptible to seizure, as a “paper trail” eventually leads the government to the coin’s ﬁnal destination. 
BTC holders can swap into Zcash to sever the chain of custody, “air-gapping” their wealth from surveillance. Once funds enter the shielded pool, 
the destination address becomes a cryptographic “black hole” to observers. Regulators can track funds leaving the Bitcoin network, but they

cannot see where they ultimately end up, rendering the assets invisible to state actors. While oﬀ-ramping to domestic banks remains a bottleneck, 
the assets themselves are censorship-resistant and diﬃcult to trace proactively. The strength of this anonymity depends entirely on operational 
security; reusing addresses or acquiring funds via KYC’d exchanges creates a permanent link before shielding ever occurs. 
Paving the Road to PMF 
The demand for private money has always existed; Zcash simply struggled to meet users where they were. For years, the protocol was burdened 
by intensive memory requirements, lengthy proving times, and cumbersome desktop setups, which made shielded transactions slow and 
intimidating for most users. A recent convergence of infrastructure breakthroughs has systematically dismantled these barriers, priming it for user 
adoption. 
 
The Sapling upgrade reduced memory requirements by 97% (to ~40 MB) and cut proving times by 81% (to ~7 seconds), paving the way for 
shielded transactions on mobile devices.

While Sapling solved for speed, trusted setups remained a concern within the privacy community. By implementing Halo 2, Orchard eliminated 
Zcash’s reliance on a trusted setup, making it fully trustless. It also introduced Uniﬁed Addresses, which bundle transparent and shielded pools 
into a single destination, removing the need for users to manually select between address types. 
These architectural improvements culminated in the release of Zashi, a mobile wallet developed by the Electric Coin Company in March 2024. 
Leveraging the abstraction of Uniﬁed Addresses, Zashi reduced the friction of shielded transactions to a few taps on a screen, making privacy the 
default user experience (UX). 
With the UX hurdle cleared, distribution remained an issue. Users still relied on CEXs to deposit and withdraw ZEC into their wallets. The

integration of NEAR Intents removed this dependency. NEAR Intents enable Zashi users to swap supported assets (e.g., BTC, ETH) directly into 
shielded ZEC without ever interacting with a CEX. NEAR Intents also allow users to pay any address across 20 blockchains in any supported 
asset while funding the transaction with shielded ZEC. 
Together, these initiatives allowed Zcash to bypass historical frictions and access global liquidity, meeting the market exactly where it is. 
Looking Ahead 
 
Since 2019, the rolling correlation between ZEC and BTC has been in a deﬁnitive downtrend, declining from highs of 0.90 to recent lows of 0.24. 
ZEC’s rolling beta to BTC has risen to all-time highs, meaning ZEC now ampliﬁes BTC’s price action even as their rolling correlation has fallen. 
This divergence signals that the market is beginning to assign an idiosyncratic premium to Zcash’s privacy guarantees. Looking forward, we 
expect ZEC’s performance to be deﬁned by this "privacy premium," the value the market ascribes to ﬁnancial anonymity in an era of increasing 
surveillance and the weaponization of the global ﬁnancial system.

We believe it is extremely unlikely that ZEC overtakes BTC. Bitcoin’s transparent supply and unassailable auditability have cemented it as the 
soundest form of cryptomoney. Zcash, by contrast, will continue to carry the inherent trade-oﬀs of a privacy coin. By encrypting the ledger to 
preserve privacy, it sacriﬁces auditability and introduces the theoretical risk of inﬂation bugs, undetected supply inﬂation within the shielded pool, 
that Bitcoin's transparent ledger explicitly eliminates. 
Regardless, ZEC can carve out its own niche independent of BTC. The two assets are not competing to solve the same problem, but rather address 
diﬀerent use cases within cryptomoney. BTC is positioned as sound cryptomoney optimized for transparency and security, while ZEC serves as 
private cryptomoney, optimized for conﬁdentiality and ﬁnancial privacy. In that sense, ZEC’s success does not require displacing BTC, but rather 
complementing it by oﬀering properties Bitcoin deliberately does not. 
Application Money Emerges in 2026 
One trend that we expect to continue accelerating in 2026 is the viability of application money. Application money is a monetary asset designed 
speciﬁcally to serve a singular purpose within an application, rather than being a general-purpose monetary asset such as BTC or L1 tokens. To 
understand why application money becomes viable in crypto environments, we must ﬁrst revisit two foundational principles about money itself: 
● Money’s value is derived from the goods and services it can be exchanged for. 
● Participants converge on shared monetary standards when the costs of switching between monetary systems are high. 
Historically, money emerged as a mechanism to store value created through economic activity. Because most goods and services are perishable or 
time-bound, money allows participants to preserve purchasing power and exchange it later. Importantly, money is not inherently valuable; its value 
is a reﬂection of what it can purchase within a given economic context. 
As economies expand and interact, multiple monetary systems follow a power law and tend to collapse into a single dominant standard. This 
convergence is driven by high frictions associated with switching between monetary systems, including slow settlement, limited liquidity, 
information asymmetry, intermediaries, and the physical diﬃculty of moving money across distances. Under these conditions, monetary network 
eﬀects reinforce the dominance of the most widely accepted currency, making independent monetary standards increasingly ineﬃcient. 
Crypto fundamentally alters these dynamics by dramatically reducing the aforementioned frictions. In these low-friction environments, smaller, 
application-speciﬁc monetary systems become viable, as users can seamlessly enter and exit them without incurring prohibitive costs. As a result, 
applications no longer need to rely on general-purpose monetary systems. Instead, they can create application-speciﬁc monetary systems 
that allow them to internalize and retain the value generated by their own economic activity. 
2025 provided multiple working proofs of concept for application-level monetary systems, most notably Virtuals and Zora.

Virtuals 
 
Virtuals is one of the ﬁrst examples of a crypto application, not a blockchain, successfully implementing its own monetary system. The platform 
allows users to create, deploy, and monetize AI agents without any technical expertise. Each AI agent launched on Virtuals issues a corresponding 
token, which is paired with the VIRTUAL token for liquidity. In this structure, VIRTUAL functions as the base monetary asset of the Virtuals 
ecosystem. Whenever a user acquires an agent’s token, VIRTUAL is deposited into that agent’s liquidity pool. Under this structure, the value of 
VIRTUAL is tied to the economic activity taking place on the platform; the more valuable and widely used the AI agents become, the stronger the 
underlying demand for VIRTUAL. In this sense, VIRTUAL operates as money as it is the unit through which all agent-level value circulates 
within the Virtuals economy. 
Zora

## Page 50

49 
Zora is another example of a crypto application implementing an application money structure. Zora is a ﬁnancialized social media platform where 
both proﬁles and posts are tokenized. When a user creates a proﬁle, a corresponding creator coin is created. Every post they publish issues its own 
token, known as a content coin. Zora extends the quote pairing model popularized by Virtuals by pairing all creator coins with the ZORA token, 
and pairing each creator’s content coins with that creator coin. 
 
Zora also improves upon the application money model through its own integrated wallet, which completely abstracts away the monetary layer 
from the end user. Users can denominate in whichever asset they prefer, such as ETH or USDC, when purchasing creator or content coins, and the 
underlying swap from ETH/USDC → ZORA → creator coin → content coin is abstracted from the user experience. Furthermore, users can swap 
directly from one creator’s content coin to another creator’s content coin, further streamlining the ﬂow of assets. 
Application Money Design Choices 
There are two design patterns that enable application money models to function reliably.

## Page 51

50 
First, automated market maker (AMM) liquidity pools enable continuous liquidity and enforce economic relationships by algorithmically setting 
asset prices and trade execution rules through smart contracts. In Virtuals, every agent token is paired against VIRTUAL; in Zora, every creator 
coin is paired against ZORA, and every content coin is paired against the creator coin. This structure binds the value of the application money to 
the activity the application is trying to cultivate. 
Second, successful application money systems abstract the monetary layer away from the user. Users do not want to change their monetary 
preferences for each application. Application money systems work best when they remove this burden entirely. Users can denominate in 
whichever asset they prefer, and only when they engage with the application is that asset converted into the application’s monetary asset, 
completely abstracted away from the user. 
When Application Money Makes Sense 
Just because crypto makes application money viable does not mean every application should adopt an application money model. Application 
money works best when network eﬀects amplify the value of the underlying application. In these cases, the monetary layer helps ensure that the 
value created on the application is captured within the ecosystem itself. 
For example, on Zora, when high-proﬁle users join, they bring attention, liquidity, and new onchain actions that ﬂow back into demand for ZORA. 
Since the liquidity of all creator coins is paired with ZORA, increases in ZORA’s price mechanically put upward pressure on creator-coin prices.

We can observe this eﬀect directly. On November 12, Uniswap founder Hayden Adams created a Zora account, thereby launching his creator coin. 
Right before the launch, ZORA traded at $0.055. In the hours following the launch, ZORA rose to a local high of $0.071, and eight hours after 
Hayden Adam’s launch, ZORA remained 23% higher than it was twelve hours prior. This price increase was also observed in creator coins on 
Zora. For example, DOCKER and COINAGE, two popular creator coins on Zora, rose 35% and 7% in the same twelve-hour period, respectively. 
For Zora to function eﬀectively as a social network, it must operate in this way. All else equal, an account on a network with one million 
participants is more valuable than an account on a network with one hundred participants. As participation increases, the value of the network 
rises, and the value of each individual account increases alongside it. By denominating activity in ZORA rather than a general-purpose asset like 
USDC, these network-driven pricing dynamics are internalized. If USDC were the base monetary asset, this value capture would not occur. 
Purchasing Hayden Adams’s creator coin would generate no direct demand for ZORA, nor would it meaningfully translate into demand for 
related assets such as DOCKER or COINAGE. As a result, ZORA serves as the mechanism through which Zora captures and compounds the 
value created by growing social activity on the network.

More Projects will Experiment with Application Money in 2026 
Early examples such as Virtuals and Zora show that, in low-friction crypto environments, applications can internalize economic activity rather 
than externalize it to general-purpose monetary assets. As tooling improves and these models become better understood, application money is 
likely to be increasingly viewed as a viable design choice for applications with strong native network eﬀects. 
For applications, the motivation is straightforward. Application money allows projects to directly capture the value generated by the activity they 
are trying to cultivate, whether that activity is social interaction, content creation, or coordination. In applications where participation compounds 
over time, relying on a neutral settlement asset can dilute these dynamics, whereas an application-speciﬁc monetary layer reinforces them. 
Just because application money can work, however, does not mean it is appropriate for every application. The model is most eﬀective in contexts 
where user growth ampliﬁes the value of each participant, rather than merely increasing aggregate activity. In these environments, an 
application-speciﬁc monetary layer can meaningfully reinforce the dynamics the product is designed to cultivate. Where this condition does not 
hold, introducing application money risks adding complexity without materially improving value capture. As an example, in ﬁnancially oriented 
protocols such as lending platforms or perpetual DEXs, user growth does not increase the value of individual positions in the same way. In those 
cases, introducing application money adds complexity without creating meaningful economic beneﬁt. 
Even for applications that do adopt application money, there are trade-oﬀs. Application money is likely to be more volatile than more established 
forms of money such as stablecoins, BTC, or even L1 tokens. If an application’s users are sensitive to volatility, an application money model could 
have the opposite of its intended eﬀect on user growth. Additionally, even though crypto signiﬁcantly reduces swapping costs, it is not costless. 
Slippage and fees can still represent meaningful costs, and if an application’s users are highly cost-sensitive, the application may need to 
reconsider whether application money is preferable to a general-purpose monetary asset. 
Finally, broader adoption of application money would have downstream implications for L1 value accrual. To the extent that economic activity is 
increasingly denominated in application-speciﬁc assets, a smaller share of value would ﬂow directly into demand for L1 tokens. In this scenario, 
L1s would continue to accrue value through fees, security, and execution, but applications would be less reliant on the base asset as a monetary 
standard. Over time, this dynamic could place pressure on L1 monetary premiums, particularly for chains whose value proposition is closely tied 
to their role as cryptomoney. 
A Parting Note on Stablecoins 
Finally, as we wrap up this section on cryptomoney, we want to acknowledge stablecoins. In the next section, we’ll explore how TradFi and crypto 
are increasingly converging, with stablecoins playing a central role in that process. 
This convergence is undoubtedly a positive development, and arguably one of the industry’s most important successes in 2025. Stablecoins have 
expanded access, improved eﬃciency, and delivered real-world utility to millions of people. That progress should not be minimized, but it is also 
worth remembering that this is not all crypto has to oﬀer the world.

Crypto’s original ambition was not simply to make today’s ﬁnancial infrastructure work better, but to make entirely new monetary systems 
possible. Stablecoins are a powerful tool within that broader vision, but they are not its endgame. As the industry continues to mature, the risk is 
not that stablecoins succeed, but that their success overshadows cryptomoney, the foundational innovation at the heart of crypto itself. 
The Convergence of TradFi x Crypto 
Authors: Qorban Ferrell, Jake Koch-Gallup 
Key Themes 
● The GENIUS Act recast stablecoins from crypto-native trading tools into instruments of U.S. monetary policy and unleashed competition 
across banks, ﬁntechs, and tech giants to control the rails for digital dollars. 
● Tether's $500 billion valuation reﬂects extraordinary proﬁtability, but the GENIUS Act invited JPMorgan and Google into the market to 
compete. We expect Tether to retain its dominance in dollarizing economies where compliance is less of a concern, while branded 
incumbents capture the developed world. 
● While banks retroﬁt stablecoins into existing payment ﬂows, Cloudﬂare and Google are building for agentic commerce that barely exists 
yet. We expect the merger of tech, ﬁnance, and AI to dominate 2026 as agent-driven transactions scale these rails. 
● Falling interest rates will direct capital toward crypto-native yields, including funding spreads, token arbitrage, and GPU-backed lending. 
The returns from real cash ﬂows, rather than token inﬂation, will support a sturdier yield cycle. 
● Tokenized RWAs reached $18 billion in 2025, concentrated in Treasuries and credit, where product-market ﬁt emerged ﬁrst. DTCC's SEC 
authorization to tokenize U.S. securities will expand this footprint and route trillions onto crypto rails. 
Welcome to the Big Leagues 
From the beginning, the crypto movement has faced an unrelenting uphill battle for legitimacy and adoption. The resistance was inevitable given 
that crypto represents a direct challenge to the state's monopoly over money. That threat was easy to dismiss when Bitcoin was small, but once it 
grew, ignoring it was no longer an option. 
Once it became impossible to ignore, every major expansion of the cryptoeconomy provoked an aggressive backlash from policymakers. In June 
2011, U.S. Senators Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin publicly urged federal authorities to crack down on Bitcoin after media coverage of Silk 
Road, the anonymous marketplace that had become Bitcoin’s ﬁrst major use case. Law enforcement agencies and policy reports soon cast crypto 
chieﬂy as a conduit for cybercrime and money laundering. By December 2013, the People’s Bank of China barred ﬁnancial institutions from 
handling it, which triggered the ﬁrst of many price crashes driven by regulatory fear. This early cycle of scrutiny and restriction established a

pattern in which Bitcoin and the state consistently appeared as opposing interests rather than natural partners. 
Under Siege 
Alongside regulatory crackdowns, each major crypto cycle had been met with scorn from the most powerful ﬁgures in traditional ﬁnance. In 
September 2017, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon delivered one of the most notorious condemnations of Bitcoin, calling it “a fraud… worse 
than tulip bulbs. It won’t end well. Someone is going to get killed,” and even threatening to ﬁre any employee trading it “in a second” because 
“they are stupid.” That same year, BlackRock’s Larry Fink dismissed Bitcoin as an “index of money laundering.” In May 2018, Warren Buﬀett 
labeled Bitcoin “probably rat poison squared,” while his longtime partner Charlie Munger described those within the crypto industry as having 
“dementia.” Janet Yellen characterized Bitcoin as “highly speculative” and often used for “illicit transactions.” By 2022, skepticism had hardened 
into outright dismissal at the highest levels of central banking, with ECB President Christine Lagarde stating bluntly, “My very humble 
assessment is that it is worth nothing.” 
 
Hostility toward crypto peaked during the 2022–2024 campaign “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” a label Nic Carter coined for regulators’

coordinated push to marginalize the industry. Between late 2021 and early 2023, the OCC’s Interpretive Letter 1179, the FDIC’s FIL‑16‑2022, and 
the Federal Reserve’s SR 22‑6 all created a framework that forced banks to seek supervisory “non‑objection” and give advance notice before 
engaging in crypto activities, while a January 2023 joint statement from all three agencies warned that crypto‑concentrated business models posed 
“signiﬁcant safety and soundness concerns.” The extent of this strategy only became clear in December 2024, when Coinbase obtained internal 
FDIC emails via FOIA showing at least 23 “pause letters” instructing banks to “pause all crypto asset‑related activity.” Coinbase’s chief legal 
oﬃcer concluded that this was “no conspiracy theory” but a concerted plan to deny banking services to a lawful American industry. 
The consequences of this coordinated eﬀort were immediate. Silvergate Bank announced voluntary liquidation in March 2023, citing mounting 
supervisory pressure. Days later, Signature Bank was seized, and board member Barney Frank alleged it was done “to send a very strong 
anti‑crypto message,” with the FDIC excluding $4 billion in crypto deposits from the sale. Smaller ﬁrms, such as Anchorage Digital, lost banking 
relationships and laid oﬀ staﬀ, and founders like Frax Finance’s Sam Kazemian were told by JPMorgan that their accounts would be closed if 
crypto was their primary source of income. For the ﬁrst time, the full weight of the U.S. banking‑regulatory apparatus had been directed at cutting 
crypto oﬀ from the ﬁnancial system. 
In parallel with the banking regulators' eﬀorts to cut crypto oﬀ from the ﬁnancial system, the SEC, under Chair Gary Gensler, waged a frontal 
assault from the securities side through what critics called “regulation by enforcement.” Sworn in on April 17, 2021, Gensler became the 
industry’s primary antagonist, insisting that existing securities laws already covered most crypto assets while declining to issue new, tailored rules. 
Instead, his SEC ramped up enforcement by bringing over 125 crypto-related cases (about 80% more than his predecessor) and extracting over $6 
billion in penalties, including a record haul in 2024 alone. High‑proﬁle lawsuits against Ripple, Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken created pervasive 
uncertainty about which tokens or business models could legally operate in the U.S., with outcomes that shut down products like Kraken’s U.S. 
staking service and branded major exchange tokens as unregistered securities. A wave of Wells notices to ﬁrms like Paxos, Uniswap Labs, 
Robinhood Crypto, Consensys/MetaMask, and OpenSea sent the message that even companies attempting to engage with regulators in good faith 
could be targeted.

Faced with this onslaught, major U.S. players began looking abroad. Coinbase launched an international exchange in Bermuda, Gemini expanded 
in Singapore, and CEOs openly discussed relocating if necessary, while Senator Cynthia Lummis warned that Congress’s failure to pass clear 
rules was “pushing the industry to other countries.” Combined with Operation Choke Point 2.0 on the banking front, Gensler’s SEC persuaded 
many industry builders that the United States had become a legal mineﬁeld for crypto businesses. 
2025 brings a full regulatory reversal 
After years of debanking, “regulation by enforcement,” and open hostility from regulators and Wall Street, the backlash ﬁnally boiled over in the 
2024 election cycle. The Biden administration’s hardline approach had alienated a sector with tens of millions of U.S. users and thousands of 
companies. That alienation created a clear political opening for anyone willing to run as a pro-crypto candidate. The industry responded by 
mobilizing at a scale never seen before. Firms like Coinbase and Ripple invested $119 million in federal races, making crypto the second-largest 
source of corporate election spending and turning super PACs, such as Fairshake, into kingmakers for pro-crypto candidates.

At the same time, politicians realized there were votes to be won by siding with an industry that felt under siege. Donald Trump leaned into that 
anger as he branded himself a “Crypto President” and promised to reverse the prior administration’s crackdown. Meanwhile, ﬁgures like Robert F. 
Kennedy Jr. ﬂoated pro-Bitcoin proposals as part of a broader populist economic message. By the time Trump took oﬃce in 2025, years of 
punitive policy had failed to kill crypto. Instead, those policies helped forge a well-funded political constituency that handed his administration 
both the mandate and the incentive to execute a complete reversal. 
The reversal came with startling speed as campaign promises on crypto were almost immediately translated into SEC policy. After years of 
Gensler-era “regulation by enforcement,” he announced his departure on Nov. 21, 2024, eﬀective at noon on Jan. 20, 2025, precisely as Trump 
was sworn in. The very next day, Commissioner Mark Uyeda took over as Acting Chair and wasted no time signaling a break with the past, 
publicly calling Gensler’s approach “a disaster for the entire industry.” 
On January 21, Uyeda’s ﬁrst act was to launch an SEC Crypto Task Force led by Commissioner Hester Peirce (“Crypto Mom”), with a mandate to 
deﬁne when digital assets are or are not securities, create clear registration pathways for token projects and exchanges, and explore retroactive 
relief for prior token oﬀerings. That same day, the SEC issued Staﬀ Accounting Bulletin 122, rescinding SAB 121’s requirement that custodians

book client crypto as liabilities on their own balance sheets, which was an accounting trick that had eﬀectively blocked banks from oﬀering 
large‑scale custody. With Paul Atkins conﬁrmed 52–44 on April 9 and sworn in as the 34th SEC Chair on April 21, the personnel and policy 
architecture of the Gensler era had been dismantled in a matter of months. 
Uyeda’s swift policy actions initiated the dismantling of the Gensler-era regime and the “Choke Point 2.0” debanking apparatus targeting crypto 
ﬁrms. On Jan. 23, 2025, Trump signed the executive order "Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology," establishing the 
President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets (chaired by AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks), banning CBDCs, protecting crypto ﬁrms' 
banking access, revoking Biden's digital assets order, and mandating regulatory recommendations. Within months, banking regulators withdrew 
restrictive guidance, the SEC dropped enforcement against Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Ripple, and others, and the Justice Department dissolved 
its National Crypto Enforcement Team. By April 2025, the anti-crypto regulatory framework was dismantled. 
With regulatory hostility removed, the crypto industry gained newfound legitimacy. On March 6, 2025, Trump signed an executive order 
establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, directing the U.S government to retain approximately 200,000 BTC previously seized through criminal 
forfeitures. Legislative milestones soon followed, delivering the ﬁrst comprehensive federal framework for crypto. The GENIUS Act, signed into 
law in July 2025, requires stablecoins to maintain 100% reserve backing, provide monthly disclosures, and comply with anti-money laundering 
rules, all while clarifying that payment stablecoins are neither securities nor commodities. Meanwhile, the CLARITY Act, having passed the 
House, aims to assign regulatory authority between the SEC and CFTC based on asset classiﬁcation and is awaiting Senate approval. Further 
reinforcing Bitcoin’s strategic role, the BITCOIN Act, reintroduced in March 2025, proposes purchasing one million BTC over ﬁve years with a 
mandatory 20-year holding period, building directly on Trump’s executive order.

No Crying in the Casino 
The regulatory relief, however, came with a price. Just days before taking oﬃce, Donald Trump launched his own memecoin (TRUMP), with 
entities he controlled holding most of the supply. The token brieﬂy soared to a $15 billion market cap before collapsing by over 90%, leaving 
hundreds of thousands of investors deep in losses, while Trump-linked entities reportedly captured hundreds of millions in sales and fees. In 
parallel, the family’s DeFi venture, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), raised more than half a billion dollars through token sales, with the bulk of 
the funds ﬂowing to Trump-aligned entities, alongside a large personal allocation of WLFI tokens.

Dhabi’s MGX shortly before the White House approved key U.S. chip exports to the UAE. Critics across the political spectrum seized on the 
overlap between policy and proﬁt, with Representative Jamie Raskin calling the network “the world’s most corrupt crypto startup operation.” 
The crypto industry achieved what it had long sought: regulatory clarity, bank access, and peace of mind with Washington. But it also became 
entangled in presidential business interests on a scale that would have been unthinkable a year earlier. 
Using crypto rails to entrench dollar supremacy 
Whatever one makes of the politics, the regulatory clarity of 2025 has unleashed a wave of institutional building that eclipses anything the industry 
managed under regulatory siege. And at the center of that construction sits stablecoins. Once dismissed as mere trading instruments for 
speculating on volatile tokens, dollar-pegged stablecoins have become the most consequential application of crypto: the bridge between the 
cryptoeconomy and legacy ﬁnance, and increasingly, a tool for projecting American monetary power abroad. 
 
With over $300 billion in circulation and $26 trillion in annual transaction volume, stablecoins now underpin both DeFi and the emerging

architecture of global dollar dominance. Passed in July 2025, the GENIUS Act made stablecoins part of the nation’s ﬁnancial infrastructure and 
sparked a land grab among banks, ﬁntechs, and tech companies to control the pipes for digital dollars. With regulatory clarity now in place, we 
anticipate that this competition will accelerate stablecoin adoption. 
The GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) establishes the ﬁrst federal regulatory framework for 
payment stablecoins. The legislation passed with bipartisan support (68–30 in the Senate and 308–122 in the House), a rare consensus that 
stablecoins serve American strategic interests. The Act requires issuers to maintain one-to-one reserve backing in permitted assets such as U.S. 
Treasuries, demand deposits at insured institutions, Federal Reserve balances, and government money market funds. Issuers with more than $50 
billion in circulation must provide monthly public disclosures, executive certiﬁcations, and independent audits, with transparency standards that 
surpass those applied to traditional banks. 
 
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent views stablecoins as a ﬁscal tool to reinforce the dollar’s position and boost demand for U.S. debt. At the 
Treasury Market Conference in November 2025, Bessent declared that stablecoins "will buttress the dollar's status as the global reserve currency" 
while driving "a surge in demand for U.S. Treasuries." He projects a $3.7 trillion stablecoin market by 2030, which would generate over $1 trillion

in new structural demand for U.S. government debt. Tether already holds $135 billion in Treasuries as the relationship between stablecoin issuers 
and American ﬁscal interests has become structural. In April 2025, Fed Chair Jerome Powell endorsed the framework, saying stablecoins "could 
actually have fairly wide appeal and should contain consumer protections." 
 
Stablecoins also serve as a vehicle for maintaining dollar dominance abroad. Dollar-pegged stablecoins account for 99% of the global supply, and

approximately 90% of USDT transactions occur outside the United States. In Sub-Saharan Africa, stablecoins account for 80% of all crypto 
transaction volume. In Turkey, stablecoin transactions account for 4.3% of the country's GDP. This amounts to de facto dollarization through 
private infrastructure, a phenomenon the European Parliament has described as "cryptomercantilism." This trend will persist as global liquidity 
strains drive capital irresistibly toward dollar assets, with stablecoins serving as the programmable infrastructure that ampliﬁes U.S. demand 
worldwide. 
 
Tether's treasury eclipses nation-states 
Tether is now the world’s 18th-largest holder of U.S. Treasuries, a position that places it alongside sovereign investors in the global dollar market.

In 2025, USDT's market cap reached $184 billion and represents 60% of the stablecoin market. The company's ﬁnancial performance deﬁes 
traditional ﬁntech comparisons. Year-to-date proﬁts through Q3 2025 exceeded $10 billion, with a projected 2025 net income of approximately 
$15 billion at a 99% proﬁt margin. This proﬁtability derives almost entirely from reserve income on U.S. government securities. Tether eﬀectively 
operates as a $180 billion money market fund with crypto distribution rails. 
Tether is now seeking a private placement of $15-20 billion in exchange for approximately 3% equity, which implies a $500 billion valuation that 
would rank it among SpaceX and OpenAI as the world's most valuable private companies. Cantor Fitzgerald, which already owns approximately 
5% of Tether, is advising the transaction. 
Despite regulatory exclusion from the EU market under MiCA, Tether's dominance in emerging markets remains unassailable. The company 
relocated its headquarters to El Salvador in January 2025 and has hired Bo Hines, a former White House oﬃcial, to lead U.S. market re-entry 
through a new GENIUS Act-compliant stablecoin called USAT, to be issued through Anchorage Digital with Cantor Fitzgerald as reserve 
custodian.

Tether's position looks unassailable today, but it may not be by the end of 2026. The same proﬁtability that commands a $500 billion valuation has 
drawn the attention of institutions with far larger balance sheets and distribution networks. The GENIUS Act removed the regulatory uncertainty 
that kept them on the sidelines. Now JPMorgan, PayPal, Visa, and Google are all entering the stablecoin market. Tether will likely keep its 
dominance in the markets where it matters most, the dollarizing economies where regulatory status is irrelevant. But in the developed world, 
branded incumbents will erode Tether’s market share through superior compliance and integration.

Banks mobilize for the stablecoin era 
JPMorgan has operated a crypto-based settlement infrastructure since 2019, now branded as Kinexys Digital Payments. The platform has 
processed over $1.5 trillion cumulatively and handles approximately $2 billion daily in cross-border transactions for institutional clients, including 
Siemens, BlackRock, and Ant International. In June 2025, the bank launched JPMD (JPMorgan Deposit Token), which CEO Jamie Dimon 
described as "eﬀectively the same thing" as a stablecoin. Dimon stated in July 2025: "We're going to be involved in both JPMorgan Deposit coin 
and stablecoins to understand it, to be good at it." 
Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan conﬁrmed in February 2025 that the bank will issue a stablecoin when regulatory clarity permits: "It's 
pretty clear there's going to be a stablecoin, which is going to be fully dollar-backed... It's no diﬀerent than a bank account... If they make that 
legal, we will go into that business." Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser conﬁrmed in July 2025 that Citi is "looking at the issuance of a Citi stablecoin,"

while emphasizing the bank's existing Citi Token Services platform, which already processes billions in tokenized deposits across New York, 
London, and Hong Kong. 
A joint stablecoin initiative involving JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo operates through Early Warning Services (Zelle's 
operator) and The Clearing House. It entered early exploration in May 2025. Separately, a nine-bank global consortium including Goldman Sachs, 
Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas, UBS, and others announced plans for a G7-currency-backed stablecoin on public networks. 
BNY Mellon has positioned itself as the dominant custodian for stablecoin infrastructure rather than an issuer. The bank serves as the primary 
custodian for Circle's USDC reserves and was selected in July 2025 as the primary custodian for Ripple's RLUSD. In November 2025, BNY 
launched the Dreyfus Stablecoin Reserves Fund (BSRXX), a money market fund speciﬁcally designed to hold GENIUS Act-compliant reserves 
for stablecoin issuers. 
Bank stablecoins will capture institutional ﬂows where counterparty risk controls and regulatory assurance are paramount. Corporate treasurers 
and asset managers will favor a JPMorgan or Citi stablecoin over USDT for the same reason they favor a JPMorgan prime brokerage account over 
an oﬀshore alternative. The main risk is that these products could remain closed-loop instruments. If bank stablecoins only move inside their 
issuers’ networks, they function as high-speed wires or intrabank settlement tokens, not as programmable, interoperable money. The joint 
initiative via Early Warning Services indicates that banks see value in shared rails, but it remains unclear whether competitive dynamics will allow 
meaningful interoperability. Fintechs, by contrast, are structurally better positioned to integrate across venues and counterparties without needing 
industry-wide coordination. 
Stripe and PayPal compete for payment stablecoin dominance 
In February 2025, Stripe completed its $1.1 billion acquisition of Bridge, the largest crypto deal by a major payments ﬁrm. Bridge delivers 
stablecoin infrastructure APIs that enable businesses to issue, manage, and accept stablecoins without directly interacting with digital assets. Its 
notable clients include SpaceX for global treasury operations and government entities handling Latin American aid disbursement. 
In September 2025, Stripe launched Open Issuance, which allows businesses to launch and manage their own branded stablecoins while capturing 
yield from reserves. The company is also developing Tempo, a high-performance Layer-1 network in partnership with Paradigm, speciﬁcally 
optimized for stablecoin merchant payments. Stripe CEO Patrick Collison characterized stablecoins as "room-temperature superconductors for 
ﬁnancial services." 
While Stripe builds the rails for others to issue stablecoins, PayPal has issued its own. PayPal's PYUSD is up over 600% year-over-year with a 
market cap of $3.8 billion. Issued by Paxos under NYDFS regulation, PYUSD has expanded from Ethereum to Solana, Arbitrum, and via 
LayerZero's omnichain protocol to Tron, Avalanche, Sei, and additional networks. With distribution across PayPal and Venmo's 400 million users, 
PYUSD oﬀers scale unmatched by crypto-native competitors.

Meanwhile, Visa and Mastercard are building infrastructure to settle stablecoins rather than mint them. Visa has expanded its stablecoin settlement 
platform to support USDC, PYUSD, USDG, and EURC across Ethereum, Solana, Stellar, and Avalanche. The network has settled over $200 
million in stablecoin payments, and CEO Ryan McInerney acknowledged the milestone while noting it remains "a very small portion of overall 
settlement volume." Visa's VTAP (Tokenized Asset Platform), launched in October 2024, enables banks to issue and manage their own digital 
tokens via API. 
Mastercard joined the Global Dollar Network (USDG) consortium in June 2025, alongside founding partners Robinhood, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, 
and Paxos. The network's unique structure shares reserve income among consortium members rather than concentrating yields with the issuer. 
Mastercard's Multi-Token Network now connects to JPMorgan's Kinexys, Standard Chartered, and Ondo Finance, with support for USDC, 
PYUSD, USDG, and Fiserv's new FIUSD stablecoin. Both Visa and Mastercard stand to settle tens of billions annually by 2027 as banks route 
wholesale payments onchain. 
Cloudﬂare and Google build the AI-native payment stack

The ﬁnancial players are retroﬁtting stablecoins into existing payment ﬂows. Meanwhile, Cloudﬂare and Google are building for a category of 
transactions that barely exists yet. Cloudﬂare announced NET Dollar in September 2025. NET is a U.S. Dollar-backed stablecoin built for "the 
agentic web" and signals technology infrastructure companies' strategic interest in stablecoin issuance. The product enables AI agent transactions, 
micropayments, and automated commerce. Autonomous agents can book ﬂights or access APIs through their programmable payments. 
Google Cloud launched the Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) in September 2025. AP2 is an open-source AI payments protocol with native 
stablecoin support developed alongside Coinbase, Ethereum Foundation, Salesforce, American Express, and PayPal. James Tromans, Google 
Cloud's Head of Web3, characterized it as "probably one of the biggest upgrades to payments since the SWIFT network." 
Google is simultaneously developing GCUL (Google Cloud Universal Ledger), a permissioned Layer-1 network for institutional ﬁnance, with 
CME Group as the ﬁrst pilot partner. The network positions itself as "credibly neutral" infrastructure: "Tether won't use Circle's blockchain, and 
Adyen probably won't use Stripe's blockchain. But any ﬁnancial institution can build with GCUL." 
Apple, Meta, Amazon, and Walmart are all reportedly evaluating stablecoin strategies. Apple has held early-stage discussions with Circle and 
Worldpay about Apple Pay integration. Meta hired Ginger Baker as VP of Product with crypto experience in May 2025 to explore creator payouts 
via stablecoins, a quiet revival of the institutional knowledge from the failed Diem project. Amazon is evaluating the issuance of stablecoins for 
cross-border supplier payments, while Walmart is exploring a USD-backed stablecoin to reduce its dependence on payment processors across its 
e-commerce and physical retail operations. 
What started as a crypto-native experiment has become a full-scale institutional land grab. Banks, card networks, ﬁntechs, and cloud platforms are 
all racing to build stablecoin infrastructure, and the payments layer is rapidly maturing. The merger of tech, ﬁnance, and AI will dominate 2026 as 
agent-driven commerce scales these rails. But payments are only half the equation. As the infrastructure commoditizes, the diﬀerentiation shifts to 
what holders actually earn. This is where crypto-native stablecoins see their opening. 
Falling rates threaten Treasury-backed stablecoins 
Tether retains all the yield from its $135 billion in Treasury reserves, which is why it earns approximately $15 billion in annual interest. Circle 
shares some yield with platforms like Coinbase, but the returns remain within the distribution network rather than being distributed to all holders. 
In contrast, yield-bearing stablecoins pass reserve returns directly to anyone who holds the token. By November 2025, the category had grown 
1400% year-over-year to $17.6 billion.

Yield-bearing stablecoins backed by U.S. Treasuries have seen rapid onchain adoption, led by products like BUIDL and USYC. The early wave of 
growth was fueled by elevated front-end yields, which made tokenized Treasury exposure especially attractive. But after three rate cuts in 2025, 
the Fed funds rate now sits at 3.50-3.75%, and the trajectory points lower. Polymarket is pricing multiple additional cuts in 2026, and Kevin 
Hassett, widely seen as the next Fed chair, argues that there is "plenty of room" to cut further. As yields compress, Treasury-backed stablecoins 
will lose appeal, while alternatives oﬀering competitive returns from crypto activity or real-world assets like GPUs become relatively more 
attractive.

Crypto-native stablecoins are poised to grow as rates fall 
The 2026 macro environment favors crypto-native yield strategies. As policy rates fall and risk-free yields compress, marginal capital tends to 
move out of the risk curve. In crypto, that reallocation historically shows up as increased leverage and more onchain activity, which expands the 
set of crypto-native yield streams available to onchain farmers. 
The clearest example is perpetual futures funding. Perps continuously balance long and short demand through periodic funding payments. In 
risk-oﬀ regimes, funding tends to hover near zero or turn negative (as in 2022), while in risk-on environments it turns persistently positive as 
traders pay premiums for leverage. During the late 2024 rally, ETH perpetual funding reached 20% annualized on some venues. For strategies 
positioned to capture this spread, such as delta-neutral spot and perp shorts, funding serves as a core revenue source that scales with demand for 
leverage.

## Page 74

73 
 
Beyond perpetuals, crypto oﬀers yield mechanisms that operate largely independent of policy rates. Locked-token arbitrage, DEX/lending fees, 
and liquidity premiums on vested tokens all emerge from market structure rather than macro conditions. Holders seeking liquidity before their 
tokens vest often sell at steep discounts, typically 10%–25% and sometimes more than 50% percent in stressed markets. A hedged buyer can 
capture that discount as tokens unlock. In this sense, crypto generates yield from the frictions and incentives embedded in its own infrastructure. 
What further strengthens crypto-native yield is composability, where protocols compound opportunities by routing collateral and leverage through 
interconnected systems. Protocols stack strategies like building blocks and allow capital to move between opportunities at internet speed. A 
yield-bearing token from one platform can serve as collateral in another, and that collateral then feeds leverage loops that route into new yield 
strategies. Ethena demonstrated how composability can transform yield into a system-wide engine, and newer stablecoins are expanding this 
model into broader, more specialized strategies. 
2025 was a breakout year for Ethena’s USDe 
Ethena's USDe was the fastest-growing stablecoin of 2025. By October, USDe's market cap had peaked at $14.8 billion and ranked third behind

USDT and USDC. The October 10 liquidation event triggered a wave of redemptions, and the market cap retraced to $7.2 billion by year's end. 
 
Ethena’s yield is derived from a delta‑neutral basis trade. When a user deposits $100 of ETH to mint USDe, the protocol goes long that ETH 
while simultaneously opening a $100 short position in ETH perpetual futures. The price exposures are oﬀset, leaving a market-neutral position 
worth $100, regardless of where ETH trades. Yield primarily comes from the funding payments collected on the short-perp position.

## Page 76

75 
 
Ethena oﬀers two tokens: 1) USDe (the base stablecoin) and 2) sUSDe (a staked version that accrues yield). By holding sUSDe, users receive the 
ongoing returns from the basis trade. In 2025, sUSDe yielded an average of 6%, about 60% higher than the current 3‑month T‑bill rate of 3.73%. 
Ethena has leaned into crypto’s composability. sUSDe is accepted as collateral across Aave, Morpho, and other lending markets where users can 
deposit sUSDe, borrow stablecoins against it, mint more USDe, stake it, and loop the trade. Pendle allows users to tokenize and trade future 
sUSDe yield separately from the principal. Within a year of launch, sUSDe was integrated across L1 and L2 networks and embedded in dozens of 
DeFi strategies. 
Ethena has also expanded its product suite to adapt to diﬀerent rate environments. USDtb is a tokenized T-bill product that lets the protocol park 
collateral in Treasuries when crypto funding rates compress. When funding spikes, Ethena leans into the basis trade. The protocol dynamically 
allocates between crypto-native yield and traditional yield based on market conditions. As rates fall and crypto activity expands, Ethena is 
positioned to capture demand on both sides of the trade. 
A new generation of long-tail stablecoins in 2026

## Page 77

The yield-bearing stablecoin market is poised to fragment and expand in 2026. Ethena captured the funding rate trade at scale, but it won't be the 
only project that succeeds. A new crop of protocols are targeting alternative yield sources, from GPU compute to locked token arbitrage to 
specialized lending markets. Each oﬀers a diﬀerent risk/reward proﬁle, collectively pointing to a future where yield-bearing stalbecoins serve 
every corner of the cryptoeconomy. 
Neutrl 
Neutrl is a market-neutral synthetic dollar protocol designed to turn OTC discounts into onchain dollar yield. It issues NUSD, a fully 
collateralized synthetic dollar that users can mint 1:1 with stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, or USDe, and then deploy across DeFi as a standard 
stable asset. Under the hood, Neutrl allocates capital into strategies like OTC arbitrage, funding-rate and basis trades, and other delta-neutral 
structures, aiming to generate yield that is structurally uncorrelated to simple lending spreads or token emissions. The protocol hedges market 
exposure on its discounted altcoin purchases with oﬀsetting derivatives positions, so returns come from locked-in spreads and funding premia 
rather than directional price moves.

## Page 78

77 
On top of NUSD, Neutrl oﬀers sNUSD, a staked, yield-bearing version that represents a claim on the protocol’s underlying strategy portfolio. 
NUSD stakers receive sNUSD and accrue yield automatically via an appreciating sNUSD:NUSD exchange rate, with returns sourced from the 
protocol’s market-neutral trading and arbitrage activity. Neutrl enforces cooldowns and optional lockups around unstaking, and manages liquidity 
via a reserve system that balances instant redemptions with queued withdrawals. 
Neutrl's edge is supply-driven rather than speculative. Token unlocks create a predictable supply of motivated sellers, and 2026's unlock calendar 
is expected to exceed $32 billion. As long as teams and investors require liquidity before their tokens vest, Neutrl has a yield source that is 
independent of interest rates, leverage demand, or market direction. 
USDai 
USDai is a synthetic dollar protocol that ﬁnances AI infrastructure by channeling DeFi liquidity into GPU-backed loans for emerging AI 
companies. Users mint USDai, a fully collateralized and redeemable synthetic dollar, by depositing stablecoins, which the protocol leverages to 
secure high-yield loans backed by tokenized physical assets, such as GPUs, through its innovative CALIBER framework. The protocol combines 
baseline Treasury bill yields with yields from infrastructure lending, creating returns that are uncorrelated with traditional crypto volatility or Fed 
policy rates.  
               
 


---

## Page 79

78 
 
The protocol issues sUSDai as a yield-bearing staked version of USDai, where holders accrue value through an appreciating exchange rate 
powered by loan interest and idle capital parked in T-bills. USDai has already surged to a market cap of $650 million, and AI compute demand 
will surge regardless of Fed rate decisions or crypto market swings. If this thesis holds, USDai delivers truly uncorrelated yield, untethered from 
the macro forces shaping most stablecoin strategies. 
Cap 
While protocols like Ethena, Neutrl, and USDai chase specialized yields, Cap aggregates liquidity across fragmented stablecoins. Its stablecoin, 
cUSD, functions as a credibly neutral synthetic dollar minted 1:1 with compliant stablecoins like USDC, USDT, or USDe, pooling them into a 
uniﬁed reserve that enables onchain swaps between assets without intermediaries or preferential treatment. This aims to solve stablecoin 
fragmentation by delivering "singleness of money" through veriﬁable smart contracts, positioning cUSD as an open settlement layer for 
frictionless value transfer in a multi-stablecoin world.

## Page 80

79 
 
On top of cUSD sits stcUSD, a yield-bearing staked token that decentralizes capital allocation via a competitive network of operators backed by 
restakers' delegated capital. stcUSD enforces veriﬁable downside protection through shared security networks, where operators must secure credit 
delegations to participate, which ensures transparent risk coverage and perpetual yield optimization invariant to market conditions. As the 
stablecoin market grows, Cap's architecture scales to capture composability premiums across DeFi, and cements cUSD as the default rail for 
neutral, high-velocity settlements. 
Yield has always been crypto’s killer app 
Yield has always been crypto's killer app. Terra's Anchor Protocol attracted $18 billion into UST by oﬀering a 20% APY, Olympus DAO reached 
a $4 billion market cap on the back of 8,000% rebasing rewards, and during DeFi Summer in 2020, TVL exploded from under $1 billion to over 
$10 billion in months as users chased liquidity mining rewards while the Fed held rates at zero. None of it lasted. Anchor was subsidized, 
Olympus ran on reﬂexive tokenomics, and DeFi Summer depended on inﬂationary emissions. Each eventually collapsed or faded into irrelevance. 
But the pattern held: oﬀer a compelling yield, and capital will follow.

## Page 81

80 
 
The diﬀerence in 2025 is that the yields are sourced from real cash ﬂows, rather than token inﬂation. Perp funding rates, borrowing interest, 
arbitrage spreads, and liquidity premiums all generate returns from actual cryptoeconomic activity rather than token printing. The yields are more 
modest, typically 5% to 15% rather than thousands of percent, but they're grounded in cash ﬂows that can persist. And the macro setup looks 
familiar. The Fed is easing, traditional yields are compressing, and the relative appeal of onchain returns is rising. The last time this happened, it 
triggered DeFi Summer. This time, the infrastructure is more mature, and the capital is more sophisticated. The conditions for another yield-driven 
expansion are forming, but with a sturdier foundation underneath. 
RWAs 
Stablecoins have given the dollar an internet-native payments rail, but real-world assets (RWAs) are turning that rail into balance sheet 
infrastructure. In this section, real-world assets refer to oﬀchain ﬁnancial and real assets, such as government debt, credit, commodities, funds, and 
equities, that are issued or wrapped as tokens on public networks. 
The promise of RWAs is that they can earn yield, serve as collateral, and settle on the same crypto rails as native tokens. The reality is more

## Page 82

81 
nuanced. Not all RWAs are created equal, and the degree of composability depends on how issuers navigate securities regulations. 
At one end of the spectrum sit fully permissioned RWAs. These tokens can only be held and transferred by whitelisted addresses, limiting 
composability to approved venues like Aave Horizon or internal settlement systems. At the other end are fully permissionless RWAs that transfer 
freely and integrate across DeFi without restrictions. Between these two categories sits a growing category of soft-restricted tokens, products like 
Ondo's USDY, which technically prohibit U.S. persons but rely on passive attestations rather than onchain enforcement. These trade with 
near-permissionless liquidity in practice. 
The regulatory environment largely determines where a given RWA lands on this spectrum. Issuers targeting U.S. investors face SEC registration 
requirements that push toward permissioned structures. Those willing to exclude U.S. persons, at least on paper, can access broader DeFi 
composability. As regulatory frameworks like the GENIUS Act mature, we expect the boundaries between these categories to shift. 
 
As of Nov. 30, 2025, tokenized RWAs held onchain reached $18.1 billion versus $300 billion in stablecoins, with approximately 550,000 RWA

holders compared with more than 205 million stablecoin holders. 
These ﬁgures reﬂect data from RWA.xyz, which distinguishes between “Distributed Assets” and "Represented Assets." Distributed Assets can 
move to wallets outside the issuing platform. Represented Assets cannot. But this binary undersells the complexity. Within distributed assets, there 
are meaningful gradations of usability. 
Some distributed RWAs can move to external wallets but remain non-transferable between users. Franklin Templeton's tokenized funds fall into 
this category, where holders custody the asset in their own wallet but cannot send it to another address. Others are transferable, but only between 
permissioned wallets, which restricts secondary liquidity to whitelisted counterparties. A third category, including products like Ondo's USDY, are 
technically restricted from U.S. persons but trade with near-permissionless liquidity in practice, relying on attestations rather than onchain 
enforcement. Only a small subset of tokenized RWAs are fully composable across DeFi without restrictions. 
In the ﬁgures that follow, unless stated otherwise, we refer to distributed assets. But readers should understand that "distributed" does not always 
mean "freely transferable" or "DeFi-composable.”

The RWA mix is more concentrated than the tokenization narrative suggests. U.S. Treasuries alone account for roughly half of the distributed 
RWA value, with sovereign debt and private credit dominating overall. Commodities and institutional funds form the next tier, while equities and 
corporate bonds remain small in absolute terms. This reﬂects where tokenization has found immediate product-market ﬁt, particularly in ﬁxed 
income and credit that can be easily integrated into onchain yield, collateral, and treasury workﬂows. As ﬁnance and crypto continue to converge, 
onchain RWA distribution will increasingly mirror TradFi market caps, with Treasuries and blue chip assets leading before equities and corporates 
scale.

## Page 85

U.S. Treasuries are the largest and most widely adopted RWA category. Tokenized U.S. Treasury products (both Distributed and Represented) 
expanded from $2.6 billion in November 2024 to $9.2 billion one year later, a more than three-fold increase. These instruments package T-bill and 
government money market exposure into tokens that can circulate with stablecoins and be deployed as collateral across DeFi and centralized 
venues. Non-U.S. government debt remains much smaller in absolute terms but is scaling quickly. Value rose from $88 million to $618 million, a 
roughly seven-fold increase YoY, reﬂecting issuer demand to replicate the tokenized cash product in multiple currencies. Treasuries' dominance 
will intensify as TradFi pipelines like DTCC route trillions onchain.

Corporate bonds remain a proof-of-concept category, but have grown from $11 million to $19 million YoY. Private credit did not register 
meaningfully onchain until 2025, yet it already accounts for $1.9 billion across more than 66,000 holders. These pools ﬁnance SME loans, 
receivables, and other oﬀchain borrowers and oﬀer yields that sit well above Treasuries, which makes them a natural next step for investors who 
already hold stablecoins and tokenized bills.

The tokenized commodity market cap (both Distributed and Represented) grew 244% YoY to $3.6 billion, with Tether Gold and Paxos Gold as the 
dominant products and more than 167,000 holders using them as digital bullion and collateral. Institutional funds have expanded even faster. 
Assets in tokenized institutional and alternative funds have increased from approximately $312 million to $2.7 billion in a year, representing a 
nearly nine-fold rise, as asset managers convert existing strategies into tokenized share classes that can integrate into crypto rails without requiring 
a reinvention of their investment process.

Tokenized public equity and ETF-like products have grown from $9 million to $633 million in a year. These instruments provide oﬀshore users 
and DeFi protocols with synthetic access to listed names and indices, while maintaining underlying custody in traditional venues. Private equity 
tokenization adds several hundred million dollars more but remains niche. The equity segment proves there is demand for tokenized securities, yet 
the asset mix as a whole makes clear that the ﬁrst serious wave of tokenization is about cash, sovereign risk, and credit rather than wholesale 
migration of global equity markets. 
Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the settlement backbone of U.S. securities markets, received a no-action letter from the SEC 
authorizing it to tokenize DTC-custodied assets in a controlled production environment. The initial rollout, expected in the second half of 2026, 
will cover U.S. Treasuries, selected equities, and index-tracking ETFs, with transfers restricted to registered wallets. While these assets will 
remain permissioned at launch, the approval marks a meaningful inﬂection point: U.S. market infrastructure is preparing to operate on blockchain 
rails under existing securities law. As SEC Chair Paul Atkins noted, U.S. ﬁnancial markets are “poised to move onchain,” reinforcing the view that 
tokenization is evolving into a settlement and balance sheet upgrade rather than a parallel ﬁnancial system.

The distribution of RWAs across blockchains is concentrated. Ethereum hosts $11.7 billion in RWA value, or a 64% share, reﬂecting its deep 
custody, liquidity, and DeFi infrastructure. BNB Chain follows at $1.6 billion and 9% share, while Solana, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Stellar each 
host between $640 million and $775 million, or 3-4% each. Polygon, Aptos, ZKsync, and XRP Ledger, and complete the top ten with smaller 
footprints. While tokenization is becoming multichain, most asset value still aggregates around Ethereum and a handful of secondary hubs where 
user demand or strategic partnerships justify support. 
Permissioned L1s like Canton will likely attract institutional-grade assets that require strict compliance, which could erode public chains' lead in 
high-value ﬂows. Ethereum maintains its edge in retail and DeFi liquidity, but issuers may route trillions of dollars to private rails for enhanced 
privacy and regulatory compliance. Bridges and standards will bridge the gap over time in order to prevent silos.

Expansion of the Multichain World 
Key Themes 
● Ethereum reaﬃrmed itself as the settlement layer for institutional crypto, dominating stablecoins and RWAs while accelerating the pace of 
network upgrades under more cohesive leadership. 
● Rollups dominate Ethereum’s execution layer, yet L2 tokens continue to underperform, exposing a growing disconnect between usage 
growth and value capture as revenues fail to justify extreme P/E multiples. 
● L2s are pivoting toward enterprises and institutions while increasing focus on revenue generation. Competition is consolidating around 
incumbents with liquidity and distribution, though Robinhood Chain and MegaETH could shake up the sector in 2026. 
● Prop AMMs advanced Solana’s vision of creating an onchain Nasdaq as the network dominated onchain spot volume, surpassing Binance 
on SOL-Stablecoin volume at times. The next opportunity is leveraging protocol upgrades to recapture perps volume. 
● The question going forward is not “which chain will win,” but which ecosystems are compounding long-term adoption in market segments 
that matter to them. 
Introduction 
Crypto is multichain. Activity and adoption is spreading across Layer-1s (L1) and Layer-2s (L2) alike. In our Multichain section, we cover 
Ethereum as the leading settlement layer, the L2 ecosystem as Ethereum’s venue for transaction throughput, and Solana as the leading 
high-performance execution environment. Various narratives emerged throughout 2025, such as Ethereum losing relevance to rollups while ETH 
underperformed, or Solana winning retail and speculative activity amid the TRUMP launch and the ensuing memecoin frenzy. Regardless of 
narratives or price action, the reality when looking back on the year is that each ecosystem is continuing on a strong growth trajectory. 
The data paints a more coherent picture. Ethereum is the default platform for regulated, institutional activity and tokenized ﬁnancial infrastructure. 
Core contributors are accelerating protocol development through major upgrades that expand rollup capacity and tighten economic alignment. L2s 
continue to absorb nearly all of Ethereum’s transaction velocity, with competition intensifying among incumbents like Base, Arbitrum, and 
Optimism. Meanwhile, Solana is sustaining its dominance in high-velocity consumer and trading activity, especially across spot volume as 
onchain liquidity matures. 
The question going forward in an ever-expanding multichain world is not “which chain wins,” but which ecosystems are compounding long-term 
adoption in market segments that matter to them. Of course, Ethereum, L2s, and Solana are not the only networks that are core to the multichain 
world. A recap of other chains and infrastructure providers and their respective outlooks are covered in detail within this section, several of which

Ethereum

Throughout 2025, Ethereum’s strategic direction and long-term value were frequent targets of debate. Questions about whether Ethereum still 
retains a meaningful moat, whether L2s weaken or strengthen the network, and whether alternative execution environments would erode 
Ethereum’s relevance all became recurring themes. If you followed only the narrative, you might assume Ethereum spent the year losing ground. 
The data tells a diﬀerent story, as Ethereum quietly reinforced its position at the center of onchain activity. It remained the dominant settlement 
layer for the categories institutions care about: stablecoins, real-world assets (RWAs), and tokenized ﬁnancial infrastructure. These are the use 
cases that brought large, risk-averse players into crypto for the ﬁrst time, and they overwhelmingly chose Ethereum. Not because of marketing or 
momentum, but because Ethereum already had a proven track record of security as well as the liquidity, tooling, compliance pathways, and 
developer depth required to support them at scale. 
Stablecoin supply expanded signiﬁcantly in 2025, growing 49% YoY from $207.34 billion to $309.96 billion, with the majority of that growth 
settling on Ethereum. The most widely adopted tokenization pilots, whether for treasuries, credit products, or money-market instruments, 
launched ﬁrst on Ethereum rails. The categories with real institutional traction and cash ﬂows concentrated on Ethereum, even as other chains 
competed aggressively on speed, cost, and incentives.

Despite new L1s like Berachain and Monad launching in 2025 and Solana memecoins capturing the lion's share of retail attention, Ethereum’s 
TVL dominance was unphased throughout the year. Starting at 56% at the beginning of the year, it reached a low of 51% in early May before 
rallying to a high of 62% in mid-August and ﬁnishing the year at 58%. As mercenary capital chases the next opportunity and new chain, 
Ethereum’s TVL moat continues to be sticky year after year.

Stablecoins 
Stablecoins were one of the leading narratives of 2025, and the entrance of new issuers helped grow crypto’s total stablecoin supply to over $300 
billion. USDT and USDC continued to dominate, ﬁnishing the year with 60% and 25% market share, respectively, but their roles diverged 
signiﬁcantly. USDT remained the preferred instrument for global liquidity and crypto-native ﬂows, while USDC saw renewed institutional 
adoption as Circle improved its compliance tooling and treasury integration. The return of net USDC issuance, after a prolonged period of 
contraction, marked one of the clearest demand signals for regulated onchain dollars in years. 
New entrants also found traction. PayPal’s PYUSD expanded its footprint across exchanges and payment platforms, helped by the company’s 
distribution rails. Stripe and Visa deepened their stablecoin integrations, bringing onchain settlement closer to mainstream commerce. On a 
smaller scale, several regional banks experimented with tokenized deposit models, blurring the line between stablecoins and traditional money 
infrastructure.

Among the six largest chains by stablecoin market share, Ethereum ended 2025 with $167.28 billion in stablecoins onchain, up 47% YoY, 
representing 59% of total stablecoin market capitalization. While USDT and USDC continued to dominate Ethereum’s stablecoin mix accounting 
for 83% of supply, 2025 also saw greater diversiﬁcation. Both USDS and USDe surpassed $5 billion in circulating supply, placing them among the 
ﬁve largest stablecoins on Ethereum. 
RWAs 
RWAs were one of the clearest areas where institutional behavior in 2025 diverged from the broader skepticism surrounding Ethereum. Tokenized 
treasuries crossed new highs as BlackRock expanded its BUIDL fund, which became one of the fastest-growing onchain products of the year. 
Franklin Templeton scaled its onchain money-market fund (FOBXX), reinforcing Ethereum’s role as the default environment for tokenized 
money-market instruments. JPMorgan’s Kinexys platform expanded its use of Ethereum-based networks for intraday repo and programmable 
payments, while WisdomTree launched additional tokenized funds directly on Ethereum's rails. All of this shows that although TradFi players 
have been slow to adopt crypto rails, when they do dip their toes in, Ethereum’s track record of uptime, security, and decentralization matters.

The beginning of 2025 raised signiﬁcant questions about Ethereum’s direction, as development seemed primarily focused on L2s, and 
stakeholders felt that Ethereum L1 was being neglected. This perception was exacerbated by the ETH/BTC ratio falling to new lows alongside a 
perceived lack of urgency from the Ethereum Foundation (EF). However, a leadership transition in March brought on a renewed sense of focus as 
Aya Miyaguchi moved from Executive Director to President, focusing on global representation and long-term strategy. Operational leadership has 
been passed to co-executive directors Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz Stańczak, bringing deeper protocol research experience and client 
development expertise into day-to-day execution. 
That same mindset shaped Ethereum’s institutional engagement. In January, the EF supported the launch of Etherealize, Ethereum’s ﬁrst 
coordinated, corporate-facing initiative. Led by Vivek Raman, Etherealize serves as a central touchpoint for institutions, combining education, 
tooling, and product development to make regulated onchain activity easier to deploy at scale. 
The response marked a shift in tone and focus. Without abandoning its decentralized development model, Ethereum began to place greater 
emphasis on execution and clarity, particularly around the role of L1. Rather than treating the base layer as a passive settlement endpoint, core

contributors increasingly framed it as the economic and security anchor upon which everything else depends. 
Community pressure played a meaningful role in that recalibration. As rollups grew, critics warned that Ethereum risked becoming too abstracted 
from its own value capture and too slow to address practical constraints such as throughput, fees, and MEV. Instead of dismissing those critiques, 
developers incorporated them into the roadmap. 
That shift was evident in 2025’s delivery cadence. For the ﬁrst time in Ethereum’s history, the network shipped two major upgrades in a single 
year, Pectra and Fusaka. Together, they marked a departure from the slower, more gradual pace that had followed the Merge, signaling a renewed 
willingness to ship meaningful protocol improvements. 
The Signiﬁcance of Fusaka 
Fusaka addressed the most important constraint in Ethereum’s scaling path: how to expand rollup throughput without turning node operation into 
an arms race. After blobs were introduced as a purpose-built data type for L2s, the key question became whether Ethereum could support higher 
blob volumes without forcing every node to download and store everything. 
Fusaka introduced coordinated changes to improve blob scaling and economics: PeerDAS distributes blob data so each node stores only a fraction, 
about one-eighth in the target design, while cryptographic guarantees preserve availability, enabling up to 8x theoretical blob scaling without 
overburdening operators; Blob-Parameter-Only (BPO) forks remove a coordination bottleneck by allowing blob targets and maximums to be 
adjusted between hard forks, turning scaling into a gradual, tunable process; and EIP-7918 introduces a reserve-price mechanism tied to execution 
costs to prevent blob fees from collapsing, ensuring a responsive fee market in which rollups pay a meaningful share of network resources. 
Beyond L2 scaling, Fusaka also hardened Ethereum’s execution layer. Caps on transaction gas size, tighter limits on historically risky computation 
paths, explicit block-size ceilings, and support for history expiry all reduced worst-case behavior and made future gas-limit increases safer. 
Looking Ahead: Ethereum in 2026 
2026 is poised to be a pivotal year for Ethereum. Over the past year, the EF, Etherealize, and core developers have appeared to respond 
meaningfully to community frustration, and the network’s direction feels more coherent than it has in several years. 
Although it’s still in the EIP coordination phase, Glamsterdam, the next major Ethereum upgrade, is likely to bring continued improvements to 
base layer economics as gas fees for smart contract execution are changed to reﬂect real resource costs. Glamsterdam will also introduce 
enshrined proposer-builder separation, which separates the entities responsible for block building and block proposing at the consensus layer, an 
important step to reduce reliance on centralized relays and further decentralize every part of the network. 
Another signiﬁcant development for 2026 is Kohaku, a new privacy initiative that plans to integrate privacy features directly into Ethereum wallets 
and developer tooling. Championed by Vitalik himself, Kohaku will enable users to shield transactions and funds, isolate dApp-speciﬁc addresses, 
and create stealth or one-time addresses. By building Kohaku as an open-source SDK, developers and existing EVM wallets will be able to

incorporate privacy as a ﬁrst-class feature of Ethereum. 
Deﬁning what ETH is remains diﬃcult, and that ambiguity is unlikely to disappear in 2026. ETH sits at the intersection of monetary asset, 
productive commodity, and technology platform, which complicates how it trades across diﬀerent market environments. It does not beneﬁt from 
the same singular narrative that has helped BTC attract consistent macro-driven ﬂows. 
Still, 2025 marked a clear shift. Both the market’s treatment of ETH and the development trajectory of Ethereum moved in a more disciplined 
direction. Additionally, all the data continued to show that Ethereum is one of the few networks with a durable long-term moat, as TVL, stablecoin 
market share, and RWA deployment were all dominated by Ethereum. That doesn’t resolve ETH’s identity problem, but it does suggest a healthier 
foundation than a year ago. Going into 2026, the outlook is best described as cautiously optimistic, driven by the fact that institutions are 
increasingly choosing Ethereum as their onchain platform of choice, and by the clarity that has emerged around Ethereum’s development direction 
over the past year.

Ethereum’s L2 ecosystem continued on its strong growth trajectory in 2025. Going back to March 2024, Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade introduced 
data blobs via EIP-4844, which drastically reduced the cost to transact on rollups while boosting their economics by increasing sequencer proﬁt 
margins. The cost to transact continued a trend toward zero this year as blob capacity doubled with the Pectra upgrade and EIP-7691 in May. Most 
recently, in December, the Fusaka upgrade introduced PeerDAS and EIP-7892, which are expected to increase throughput even further. L2 
dominance over transactions per second (TPS) relative to Ethereum breached 95% for the ﬁrst time in November. While Ethereum still holds the 
vast majority of assets, transaction velocity has been wholly outsourced to rollups.

## Page 98

Transactional capacity on L2s has gone parabolic, with total TPS averaging 50 in November 2023, and 325 in November 2025. The EVM has 
proliferated to the point that the world’s largest institutions are using it, and Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap has been achieved in many ways. 
Ethereum has scaled horizontally because of rollups, but the value of increased scale actually accruing to ETH the asset was called into question 
more than ever this year. Many have questioned whether L2s are “parasitic” to Ethereum as transaction fees are captured by centralized sequencer 
operators, assets are natively issued on rollups, and transactional activity ﬂows away from Ethereum. 
The price of ETH underperformed relative to BTC from 2022 until April 2025, when the ETH/BTC ratio bottomed as Pectra went live. Still, 
because of Ethereum’s focus on rollups over years of sustained underperformance, sentiment amongst many ETH tokenholders remains against 
the proposition that L2s are value accretive to ETH.

Over $37 billion in assets are housed on rollups. The value of stablecoins and BTC on rollups has grown 33% and 121% YTD. The “Others” 
category in the TVS chart above, which includes L2 tokens native to their respective rollups, has fallen 51% in value YTD. 
However, the long-term growth of TVS, and other DeFi metrics, hasn’t translated to chain revenue growth of the same magnitude. L2 tokens 
underperformed in 2025 and trade at extreme P/E ratios. Due to underperformance from altcoins in 2025 along with the emerging “revenue meta,” 
there is mounting pressure by the market for revenue growth from high-proﬁle L2s like Arbitrum and Optimism. 
For years, many from Ethereum’s L2 ecosystem expected tech stacks from Arbitrum, Optimism, ZKsync, and Polygon to power rollups for 
application-speciﬁc use cases as the world’s largest enterprises moved onchain. However, some of this year’s biggest splashes were stablechains 
like Stripe’s Tempo and Circle’s Arc opting for L1 architectures over L2, showing that launching a rollup is not the only route being considered by 
large enterprises. Additionally, liquidity and activity continued to concentrate amongst existing, leading L2s like Base and Arbitrum One in 2025, 
while smaller rollups struggled to sustain meaningful usage. Rollups like Pirate Nation and Polygon zkEVM were deprecated entirely this year, 
highlighting that while it is easier than ever to launch a rollup, that doesn’t mean it'll ﬁnd PMF. 
These trends are likely to persist into 2026. The price to transact on L2s will continue to fall, pushing transactional dominance by L2s relative to

Ethereum to above 99% long-term. Leading rollups should remain dominant as institutions continue to launch tokenized products onchain on 
venues with pre-existing liquidity and users, though new rollups like Robinhood Chain and MegaETH could shake things up. Regardless, L2s will 
aggressively attempt to capture interest from enterprises and institutions in 2026, while focusing on scaling revenue generation due to today’s 
market dynamics. 
As for project-speciﬁc developments, Arbitrum is creating a self-sustaining revenue engine as the launch of Robinhood Chain looms. Optimism is 
shifting focus toward institutions and regrowing OP Mainnet as Base continues its dominance. MegaETH is launching with the promise of 
next-gen performance that will enable a new class of real-time applications, while going to market with a native stablecoin that may serve as an 
example for how other L2 ecosystems could capture more value. ZKsync is doubling down on its “bank stack” thesis by productizing 
institutional-grade privacy and compliance, positioning the ZK Stack as a credible venue for regulated onchain workﬂows. Mantle is leaning into 
Bybit’s distribution and a vertically integrated yield stack to become a banking-oriented execution layer. 
Arbitrum 
Arbitrum had one of its strongest years in 2025, growing its dominance across several key metrics, locking in major partnerships for new 
Arbitrum Chains, and solidifying its long-term strategy for growth and self-sustainability. The success of Arbitrum One, and its DeFi leadership, is 
demonstrated by its $16.83 billion in TVS, $2.82 billion in DeFi TVL, and a stablecoin market cap of $8.52 billion.

## Page 101

Arbitrum One is host to the largest L2 deployments of blue chip DeFi protocols like Aave ($1.12 billion in TVL), Uniswap ($348.3 million), Fluid 
($193.7 million), and Arbitrum-native DeFi protocols like GMX ($357.4 million) and Variational ($71.4 million). The Hyperliquid Bridge sources 
all of its USDC liquidity ($4.24 billion) from Arbitrum One, driving its stablecoin market cap to be the highest amongst L2s at $8.61 billion. 
This DeFi leadership is set to expand with Robinhood Chain, in what can be argued as Arbitrum’s main catalyst going into 2026. As detailed in 
our report on Arbitrum Everywhere, Robinhood Chain will be one of the Arbitrum Chains within the Arbitrum Orbit ecosystem, of which there 
are 47 live on mainnet, 14 in testnet, and 12 in development. 
Securing Robinhood was a major win that will likely end up being a key moment in Arbitrum’s maturation. With Robinhood Chain set to launch 
in 2026, Arbitrum could have its Base-equivalent. Base makes up 82% of the Optimism Superchain’s TVL, but that level of dominance from 
Robinhood Chain is unlikely due to the focus Arbitrum places on Arbitrum One. Still, Robinhood Chain could bring the next wave of onchain 
activity to the Arbitrum Orbit ecosystem by merging a world-renowned ﬁnancial institution with the onchain capabilities of the Arbitrum Nitro 
tech stack.

Robinhood has already dipped their toes on Arbitrum One, where nearly 1,500 tokenized securities are live today, having reached a cumulative 
market cap of over $13 million. This is part of Arbitrum’s app-to-chain model that allows builders to go-to-market ﬁrst on Arbitrum One to 
bootstrap a user base and iterate on product while maintaining the ﬂexibility to migrate to a specialized Arbitrum Chain later. 
Despite all this positive momentum, L2 tokens like ARB have struggled. The token’s circulating market cap rank fell from 45th to 59th in 2025. 
However, Arbitrum-aligned entities like Arbitrum Foundation have formulated a long-term strategy meant to achieve sustained growth and 
ultimately, self-sustainability. As detailed in our report on Arbitrum's Economic Engine, ArbitrumDAO is building a Digital Sovereign Nation that 
generates revenue through digital resources like blockspace and execution environments, invests in ecosystem investment programs and economic 
zones of opportunity, and leads to compounding demand for its products, while growing its asset base.

## Page 103

102 
 
ArbitrumDAO reached an all-time high monthly revenue of $4.4 million in October. 93% of ArbitrumDAO’s revenue generation in 2025 was 
driven by its blockspace, including transaction fees paid to Arbitrum One’s sequencer and its Timeboost auctions. Additionally, Arbitrum Chains 
are required to share 10% of sequencer proﬁt with ArbitrumDAO. This revenue was miniscule in 2025, accounting for less than 1% of total 
revenue, but could expand exponentially with the launch of Robinhood Chain in 2026. 
Finally, Arbitrum is a prime candidate to introduce a native stablecoin in 2026. MegaETH will be the ﬁrst L2 to do this with USDm, while 
Hyperliquid has already done so with USDH, as was explored in our report, Hyperliquid: Stablecoin Wars. Arbitrum is already heavily 
incentivizing stablecoin activity through the DeFi Renaissance Incentive Program (DRIP), which has resulted in a dramatic increase in the market 
cap, liquidity, and borrowing of stablecoins on Arbitrum One.

Assume ArbitrumDAO was to launch a native stablecoin and incentivize its growth to account for just 5% of Arbitrum One’s stablecoin market 
cap (excluding the USDC in the Hyperliquid Bridge) of $4.23 billion. The result would be a stablecoin with $211.4 million in backing assets 
generating $7.4 million in annual yield with an underlying U.S. Treasury rate of 4%, which would further strengthen Arbitrum’s economic engine.

Optimism 
Optimism lost momentum in 2025, and the price of OP has reﬂected that. While the token’s circulating market cap rank fell from 50th to 81st this 
year, Optimism is very much still a leading L2 ecosystem alongside Arbitrum. The OP Stack powered 62% of transactions across L2s and of 14% 
of all transactions in crypto in November.

Base still carries the Optimism Superchain, leading the 33 OP Chains in most metrics, as seen in our State of the Superchain H1 2025 report. 
Securing Base required Optimism granting up to 118 million OP tokens to Coinbase (worth about $187.7 million at the time) over the span of six 
years. Base has contributed $34.5 million back to the Optimism Collective via Superchain proﬁt sharing. While a crude measurement due to price 
ﬂuctuations, it counts the ~11,500 ETH that has been contributed while assuming an ETH price of $3,000. 
The deal, and having Base as an integral part of the Superchain, has also done wonders in boosting the market’s perception of Optimism. That 
said, questions about Base’s future as part of the Optimism Superchain arise at times. This is just speculation, as the details of the deal are not 
fully public and any shake up would be years away. Still, it is a fair question to wonder when the Superchain’s next-largest rollups by contributed 
revenue, OP Mainnet and Unichain, contributed just $3.4 million and $0.5 million compared to Base’s $10.8 million.

Optimism did secure a notable win in 2025 with Ronin opting to migrate to the Optimism Superchain over competing ecosystems in September. 
That said, high-proﬁle launches from the past year like Ink, Soneium, and Unichain have contributed limited amounts of revenue back to the 
Optimism Collective. Ronin should quickly become the top gaming-focused OP Chain after it launches in 2026. Still, with the market pressure on 
projects to generate revenue intensifying, and competitors like Arbitrum putting increased focus in that area, Optimism will feel the pressure to 
match. That pressure could result in a renewed focus on OP Mainnet, which captures 100% of sequencer revenue and remains one of the 
highest-potential vectors for revenue for the Optimism Collective. 
Optimism’s co-founder, Jing Wang, recently posted about Optimism’s historical lack of focus and suboptimal token performance. Optimism has 
clearly shifted its strategy in recent months toward large enterprises, institutions, and OP Mainnet itself. If 2025 was the year of attracting big 
name OP Chains, 2026 is set to be the year of attracting institutional liquidity and new users to the Superchain and OP Mainnet, which has drifted 
into the shadows for too long and could reemerge in 2026.

Base 
In 2025, Base cemented itself as the leading L2 across a range of metrics. Few, however, illustrate its dominance over the L2 ecosystem as clearly 
as revenue. 
 
While L2 chain revenues have declined signiﬁcantly from their 2024 peak, Base has continued to capture an outsized share over the L2 market. In 
December 2023, Base generated $2.5 million in chain revenue, just 5% of total L2 revenue of $53.7 million. One year later, Base’s chain revenue 
rose to $14.7 million, accounting for 63% of the $23.5 million generated by all L2s in December 2024. This trend has persisted into 2025. 
Year-to-date, Base has generated $75.4 million in chain revenue, representing 62% of the $120.7 million in total L2 chain revenue.

## Page 108

107 
 
Base’s lead is not conﬁned to revenue, which can favor high-velocity transactions that are easier to monetize at the chain level. Base also became 
the leading L2 by DeFi TVL after ﬂipping Arbitrum One in January 2025. Today, Base’s $4.36 billion in DeFi TVL represents 46% of total L2 
DeFi TVL. Perhaps most importantly, Base’s share of DeFi TVL has steadily increased throughout 2025, rising from 33% at the beginning of the 
year. 
Base’s biggest advantage over other L2s is distribution, and it’s hard to overstate how meaningful that is. Per Coinbase’s latest 10-Q, the CEX had 
9.3 million monthly transacting users in Q3, giving Base direct access to a massive, already onboarded user base that other L2s simply cannot 
match. While most L2s must acquire users through incentives or third-party integrations, Base beneﬁts from native distribution through the largest 
American CEX.

## Page 109

Base has also distinguished itself as an environment where applications can scale into meaningful businesses. Year-to-date, applications on Base 
have generated $369.9 million in revenue. Notably, application revenue is concentrated in Aerodrome, which accounts for 43% of total application 
revenue at $160.5 million. However, Base’s premier DEX is not the only application to ﬁnd success in 2025. 
The AI agent launchpad Virtuals has generated $43.2 million in revenue, representing 12% of Base’s application revenue, while the recently 
launched sports prediction app Football.Fun has generated $4.7 million. Together, these applications point to a healthy cohort of 
revenue-generating products across multiple sectors, rather than Base’s activity being driven by a single application or use case.

The scale of this distribution advantage is best exempliﬁed through Coinbase’s partnership with Morpho, which allows Coinbase users to take out 
USDC loans against their crypto holdings directly on the platform. While the user experience lives inside Coinbase, the collateral and loan 
execution occur onchain via Morpho’s deployment on Base. Despite being live for less than a year, the product has already seen signiﬁcant 
adoption. 
Coinbase users have originated $866.3 million in loans through the partnership, which now accounts for 90% of active loans on Morpho’s Base 
deployment. Over the same period, Morpho’s Base TVL has increased 1,906% year-to-date, rising from $48.2 million to $966.4 million. Base’s 
distribution advantage means onchain activity can show up as a byproduct of product usage on Coinbase. This onboarding route is unavailable to 
other L2s, leaving them largely dependent on incentive programs to pull liquidity and users into their DeFi ecosystems.

## Page 111

110 
 
Even as Base’s DeFi TVL has grown throughout 2025 and revenue has held steady, user behavior onchain has begun to change. USDC is now the 
top application on Base by daily average ﬁltered users (unique addresses with at least two transactions and more than 0.0001 in gas spent on a 
given contract) with 83,400 users in November. That ﬁgure is up 233% year-over-year from 25,100. 
At the same time, retail interaction with DEXs has declined sharply. Daily average ﬁltered users on Uniswap and Aerodrome are down 74% and 
49%, respectively. More interestingly, DEX volumes on Base reached all-time highs in 2025, meaning that activity on Uniswap and Aerodrome is 
increasingly concentrated among larger, higher-volume traders. 
Base’s Big Bet in 2026: The Base App 
Base’s proximity to Coinbase gives it a luxury that few chains really have. It has already built a meaningful moat in users, liquidity, and 
applications. Base leads all L2s in chain revenue, has the deepest DeFi TVL in the category, and beneﬁts from a steady stream of users coming 
onchain through Coinbase. In other words, Base is not ﬁghting for relevance or traction in the way most L2s still are. 
With this moat established, Base is now looking beyond the core L2 metrics and toward the creator economy. An opportunity that, if captured,

represents nearly half a trillion dollars in total addressable market. At the center of Base’s go-to-market strategy for this direction is the Base App, 
an “everything app” that aims to bring together custody, trading, social, and other core wallet functions all in one place. Unlike most crypto 
wallets, the Base app includes several features that push beyond basic asset management: 
● A social feed powered by Farcaster and Zora. 
● Direct messaging and group chats via XMTP, including interactions with other users and AI agents such as Bankr. 
● Mini-app discovery, allowing users to access and interact with mini-apps directly within the Base app. 
 
The Base app launched in private beta in July, with access initially limited to a waitlisted, invite-only group of users. Even so, the Base app has 
seen meaningful growth. In total, 148,400 users have created an account, with signups accelerating in November, increasing 93% MoM. Retention 
also appears strong, with weekly active users at 6,300 (up 74% MoM) and monthly active users at 10,500 (up 7% MoM). Although not explicitly 
conﬁrmed, it’s likely that the Base app will exit private beta this month, setting the stage for the app to be publicly available to anyone before the 
new year.

The most important facet of the onchain economy Base is trying to build is enabling creators to earn directly from the content they produce. 
Content created on the Base app is tokenized by default (though users can opt out), turning each post into a tradable market. Creators earn a 
portion of the trading fees generated by their content, 1% of each trade. 
Looking ahead, users will also be able to launch creator coins for their accounts directly within the Base app, adding another monetization avenue 
(the feature is currently in early access). Under the hood, both creator and content coins are tokenized via Zora. To date, creators have collectively 
earned $6.1 million through Zora’s tokenization model, averaging $1.1 million in monthly payouts since July.

In total, more than 6.52 million creator and content coins have been tokenized through Zora. Of those, 6.45 million (roughly 99%) failed to reach 
ﬁve trades. Only 17,800 coins, or 0.3% of the total, continued to be traded more than 48 hours after launch. 
Before reading too much into this, it’s worth noting that the vast majority of content posted on the internet is eﬀectively valueless. In that context, 
99% of coins failing to gain traction may simply reﬂect a natural distribution of online content rather than a structural ﬂaw in Base’s approach. 
The coins that survive beyond 48 hours are the ones that matter. In our view, a creator or content coin trading beyond that window is a strong 
indicator that either the creator or the content was genuinely valuable. 
Put diﬀerently, Base has barely made a dent in the creator economy so far. Only 17,800 creator and content coins have shown sustained activity, 
which is a rounding error relative to the scale of online content produced every day. Pessimists might look at this and conclude that the model 
simply isn’t working. Optimists, however, would argue the opposite. Base’s penetration into the creator economy is eﬀectively zero, which leaves 
a massive surface area for growth if distribution, discovery, and tooling improve (perhaps from the public launch of the Base App?). Regardless, 
increasing the number of coins that reach a lifespan beyond 48 hours should be a main focus for Base in 2026.

Lastly, Base also has what may be the most potent incentive mechanism left in crypto: a token. In September, Base conﬁrmed that it is exploring a 
network token, though no concrete details around distribution, utility, or a potential launch date have been disclosed. What makes a potential 
BASE token particularly interesting is not the token itself, but how it could be used. Unlike most L2s, Base does not need a token to bootstrap 
liquidity or activity at the chain level. Instead, a token could be used much more selectively to incentivize participation in the onchain creator 
economy, rewarding behaviors that drive durable user engagement, content creation, and social activity, rather than short-term transactional 
metrics. 
Taken together, with the core L2 already established, Base is using its distribution, product surface area, and potential token incentives to push 
further up the stack and experiment with consumer and creator-native use cases at scale. If this works, Base ends up building a moat around social 
and creator behavior, one that is far stickier than DeFi TVL or stablecoin balances, and one that other L2s are largely not even attempting to 
compete on. 
MegaETH 
As explored in our report, Next-gen Chains: Strategic Diﬀerentiation, MegaETH is a much anticipated L2 making unapologetic tradeoﬀs within 
the blockchain trilemma to achieve extreme optimization toward scalability and enable the ﬁrst “real-time blockchain.” Testnet went live in March 
with many claiming MegaETH’s performance could be a step function improvement not only in the L2 sector, but for blockchains broadly.

MegaETH will feature 10 millisecond “mini-blocks” while aiming for up to 100,000 TPS. The high-level infrastructure is not radically diﬀerent 
from L2s like those powered by Arbitrum Nitro or the OP Stack. MegaETH’s performance improvements stem from network-level optimizations, 
the hardware required to run a sequencer, and the specialization of four node types that allow for an exponential increase in gas limits. 
MegaETH’s sequencer will be powerful enough to produce mini-blocks that update the network’s state while providing transaction inclusion 
guarantees for users and applications, allowing them to operate at an extremely rapid, real-time pace. The project team has curated two cohorts of 
ecosystem projects, which together, are dubbed the “MegaMaﬁa.” The MegaMaﬁa aims to take advantage of MegaETH’s performance to create 
novel applications and experiences that are only on MegaETH (OMEGA). Additionally, MegaETH’s USDm native stablecoin being integrated 
across MegaMaﬁa apps should bootstrap initial revenue generation for the network, with the opportunity to scale to something greater long-term. 
Another unique approach taken by MegaETH is in its token design. MegaETH’s rotating sequencer set will be enabled by the MEGA token, 
which will be required to be staked in order to operate a sequencer. MEGA will also be staked for the ability to bid on priority transaction 
inclusion, likely from entities needing low latency like market makers and MegaMaﬁa apps. These two use cases are novel for an L2 token, and 
could be in demand if MegaETH successfully fosters high-velocity trading activity that breeds REV. If MEGA performs well in 2026, it could

push the market to demand increased utility from pre-existing L2 tokens whose primary uses are governance and incentives. 
MegaETH has also made a concerted eﬀort to align a large base of early stakeholders with skin in the game, having allocated more MEGA to 
individual investors than to venture capital ﬁrms. Many tokens have been scrutinized for launching at a low ﬂoat, high fully diluted valuation, with 
large portions of token supply controlled by insiders. MegaETH’s approach aims for a diﬀerent outcome. Earlier rounds like the $10 million 
community sale or the mint of “The Fluﬄe” NFT came at favorable valuations. The ﬁnal round occurred this October in a public ICO that raised 
$50 million from over 5,000 investors on Echo for 5% of MEGA. MegaETH has expanded the pool of “insiders” to include individual believers 
and core community members. 
MegaETH is built diﬀerent. Not only architecturally, but also in its ecosystem and token design. These approaches could result in net-new 
primitives with adoption bootstrapped by early power users with skin in the game. Furthermore, upon the token’s launch, token inﬂation and 
vesting will be uniquely tied to performance KPIs rather than dates, with rewards being limited to stakers of the MEGA token. 
Beta mainnet just launched in early-access for builders in December. Early network activity, ecosystem growth, and token performance, all have 
the potential to exceed expectations because of MegaETH’s unique strategies. MegaETH is one to watch as the new L2 on the block that has a 
realistic shot at becoming a leading rollup by revenue in 2026. 
Mantle 
In 2025, Mantle successfully pivoted its narrative from a general-purpose L2 into a comprehensive institutional ﬁnancial crypto infrastructure. The 
majority of the protocol’s growth was spent repositioning itself away from the saturated ETH L2 category and toward a more deﬁned role as 
infrastructure for institutional onchain ﬁnance. 
Many L2s competed for retail traction throughout the year. Mantle diﬀerentiated by honing in on its vertically integrated ﬁnancial stack, using its 
rich treasury and exchange partnerships to accelerate deployment. 
What Went Right in 2025

## Page 118

MNT was the top-performing L2 token by market capitalization in 2025, standing out in a year where the broader L2 sector performed poortly. 
The token’s circulating market cap was the 3rd-largest amongst L2s at the start of 2024, but was 1st throughout 2025, remaining around the 30th 
spot throughout the year. 
Mantle’s performance in 2025 was closely tied to its exchange-aligned model through Bybit. Deep integration with Bybit (where MNT is now 
used for trading pairs, fee discounts, and VIP collateral) supported MNT’s rise to the top-ranked L2 by market capitalization by the end of 2025. 
This approach mirrors the structure of other highly active networks, including Base and BNB Chain, both of which maintain close operational and 
liquidity ties to centralized exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance. In this context, Mantle’s integration with Bybit functions as an eﬀective 
mechanism for attracting users, liquidity, and asset integrations. 
Another deﬁning move in 2025 was establishing a use case separate from the broader L2 cohort. The “banking chain” framing allowed the 
network to attract institutionally-oriented projects and anchor its valuation through periods of weak sentiment in the L2 category. 
Mantle also allocated DAO capital toward building an institutional-grade liquidity layer. This included mETH, a liquid staking asset, and cmETH, 
a restaking derivative, which collectively attracted over $1.07 billion in capital. In addition, the MI4 index fund, a tokenized portfolio designed for

crypto-native beta exposure, managed $173 million by the end of 2025. These products formed the foundation of Mantle’s structured yield 
strategy. 
In Q3, Mantle moved to an OP-Succinct ZK Validium architecture, reducing withdrawal ﬁnality to approximately six hours. It also integrated 
EigenDA to bring down data availability costs. This adjustment prioritized performance characteristics that align with institutional use cases, 
including lower transaction costs and predictable settlement times. 
2026 Outlook 
Mantle enters 2026 with multiple initiatives in motion. Its success will depend on execution across both institutional and consumer distribution 
channels. 
Launched in mid-2025, the UR mobile application serves as a front-end banking layer for crypto services. UR simpliﬁes the DeFi stack and aims 
to onboard users directly from Bybit into onchain activity. If it converts a fraction of that funnel, Mantle could establish a replicable path to retail 
distribution that most L2s have struggled to secure. 
Mantle’s TaaS (Tokenization-as-a-service) platform began with early deployments from Ondo (USDY) and World Liberty Financial (WLFI). 
Success in 2026 depends on Mantle attracting additional asset originators and gaining adoption among allocators that need fast, compliant 
settlement infrastructure for yield-bearing instruments. 
The key question for 2026 is whether Mantle can support broader development and usage beyond its exchange funnel. If native primitives like 
mETH and FBTC maintain user retention without additional incentives, and if developers deploy outside of grant programs, Mantle positions 
itself to sustain its institutional role. 
ZKsync 
2025 was a year of intense technical execution, transforming the ZK Stack into what Matter Labs calls “the Bank Stack of Ethereum,” an 
infrastructure that can bring institutions onchain with privacy, scalability, and compliance. The broader market also rediscovered privacy, with 
renewed interest in ZK-based systems, and ZKsync’s answer is to oﬀer Prividiums, private chains secured by ZK proofs rather than isolated 
permissioned ledgers.

Airbender is ZKsync’s next-generation RISC-V proof system, purpose-built to generate eﬃcient ZK proofs of RISC-V bytecode execution. It is 
built on highly optimized STARK/FRI implementations and is designed to be fast, cheap, and ﬂexible across a wide range of use cases without 
compromising security. On a single NVIDIA H100 GPU, Airbender achieves roughly 21.8 MHz of eﬀective throughput and can process an 
average Ethereum block in about 17 seconds pre-recursion and around 35 seconds end-to-end, which is signiﬁcantly faster than comparable 
open-source zkVMs. Airbender runs on consumer GPUs and standard hardware rather than large datacenters, making it realistic for institutions to 
run proving inside their own environments while still keeping proof-to-settlement windows tight enough for real ﬁnancial workﬂows. 
The Atlas upgrade took proving gains made possible by Airbender and targeted the full settlement loop rather than just “more TPS.” By pairing 
ZKsync OS with Airbender, the Atlas upgrade enabled 15,000+ TPS, ~1 second ZK ﬁnality, and ~$0.0001 a proving cost per transfer. Atlas also 
restructured the stack so the sequencer focuses on low-latency ordering while asynchronous components handle proving and posting 
commitments, and it introduced interop and messaging upgrades that cut coordination latency across chains. 
With Atlas compressing proof-to-settlement timelines and lowering proving costs, ZKsync used 2025 to expand from pure L2 scaling into an 
enterprise strategy built around Prividiums, giving institutions a path onto crypto rails without forcing them into fully public infrastructure.

Prividums have seen early traction with partners like Memento and Deutsche Bank. Each Prividium is a permissioned validium chain that runs in 
an institution’s own environment and keeps balances and transaction data private while anchoring to Ethereum through ZK proofs. The 
permissioning system and selective disclosure modules enable operators to deﬁne who can view what, while regulators or auditors can verify 
compliance without gaining full visibility into the ledger. With Interop, Prividiums can tap Ethereum liquidity directly: assets move to aliased 
accounts on mainnet, interact with protocols like Aave, and can be bridged back, all while preserving identity and permissions. This is the ﬁrst 
architecture that enables institutions to maintain private systems while still accessing Ethereum’s liquidity. 
In 2026, ZKsync plans to deprecate ZKsync Lite, the original 1.0 rollup that served as a proof of concept for production ZK systems. Lite’s sunset 
is a clear signal that in 2026, Matter Labs will be fully focused on extending the ZK Stack through the ZKsync Era as the main public hub, with 
the addition of new ZKsync OS-based chains, Prividiums for institutions, and the ZKsync Gateway as the shared coordination layer for the Elastic 
Network. 
Against that backdrop, success in 2026 is less about shipping new primitives and more about proving that this stack can carry real institutional 
workloads at scale. In practical terms, three outcomes stand out. 
Achieve PMF with Prividiums 
The ﬁrst success condition is turning early traction with Memento and Deutsche Bank into repeatable product-market ﬁt. That means onboarding 
more banks, ﬁntechs, and enterprises that run Prividiums as core infrastructure for intraday repo, cross-border payments, and internal treasury 
systems. The long-term vision is that every serious business operates its own Prividium, just as it maintains a corporate bank account today, with 
regulators using selective disclosure for oversight. Ideally, these chains will operate with interoperability enabled, allowing funds and messages to 
ﬂow seamlessly through Ethereum and other ZKsync chains, rather than remaining isolated private ledgers. 
Prove ZK Chains can “Skip the Cold Start” 
On the liquidity side, ZKsync now needs to demonstrate that “skip the cold start” is more than a slogan, which depends on ZK Chains fully 
enabling interoperability and actually driving users to tap into Ethereum liquidity. With Interop, ZK Chains and Prividiums can tap directly into 
Ethereum DeFi and transact against deep L1 liquidity using aliased accounts, without requiring isolated liquidity or custom integrations. This 
turns Ethereum into the liquidity backend for every ZK Chain, allowing actions like depositing into Aave or borrowing GHO to occur as seamless 
extensions of L2 workﬂows. The real test is whether users consistently route these ﬂows through ZK Chains. If Matter Labs can show that new 
chains launch with instant access and real usage of Ethereum liquidity, “skip the cold start” becomes a proven liquidity model rather than a 
marketing claim, and positions the ZK Stack as the ﬁrst architecture that marries private execution with public-market liquidity. 
Implement the ZK Token Flywheel 
               
 


---

## Page 122

121 
 
In 2026, success for ZKsync on the token side means implementing the proposed ZK token ﬂywheel for value accrual to the ZK token. 
Speciﬁcally, interoperability fees from cross-chain messaging and asset ﬂows, as well as licensing revenue from enterprise modules, need to be 
routed through the buy-and-allocate mechanism and used to purchase ZK on the market. Proceeds are designed to be allocated to burns, staking 
rewards, ecosystem incentives, and the treasury. 
Strategically, ZKsync enters 2026 with a diﬀerentiated position in the Ethereum L2 landscape as the ZKsync vision has developed beyond a single 
L2 to scale Ethereum into a network of interconnected ZK Chains for public and private access. ZKsync Era oﬀers EVM equivalent developer and 
user experience, ZKsync Gateway aggregates proofs and messages for cheaper and more interoperable settlement, Airbender and ZKsync OS 
provide a high-performance proving and execution stack, and Prividiums answer institutional requirements for privacy, compliance, and control 
while still relying on Ethereum’s incorruptibility, hard ﬁnality, and global liquidity. If Matter Labs can scale institutional adoption, drive 
meaningful ﬂows through interop and Gateway, and operationalize the ZK value ﬂywheel, ZKsync and the ZK Stack will be well placed to 
become the bank layer of Ethereum rather than just another generalized rollup.

Solana 
Author: Matthew Nay 
 
Solana’s year started with the now infamous TRUMP launch, where the network proved it could handle more than $36 billion in volume over a 
24-hour period, and SOL hit an all-time high of $295. With such an explosion of activity to start the year, the ecosystem had high hopes for the 
remainder of 2025. 
The year, however, turned out to be up-and-down. Similar to many tokens, SOL faced multiple 50% drawdowns, struggled to overcome being the 
“Memecoin Chain” moniker, and saw the year’s biggest narratives develop winners elsewhere, perps on Hyperliquid, payments on stablechains, 
and the institutional interest on Ethereum. 
               
 


---

## Page 124

123 
Despite this, SOL maintained its spot in the top 10 assets for the entire year, saw its stablecoin supply triple, six ETFs launched, and the network 
received a commitment from Western Union to develop its stablecoin on the chain. Despite many considering 2025 to be a down year for Solana 
compared to 2024, several key metrics, including REV, transactions, and spot volume, all indicate that Solana remains among the leading 
general-purpose L1s. 
Spot DEX Dominance 
 
Solana continued its lead in spot DEX volume this year, with $4.2 billion in volume over the last three months, resulting in a 30% market share. 
At the beginning of the year, this was primarily driven by memecoin volume but later shifted with over 50% of all volume stemming from 
SOL-Stablecoin pairs by November. We expect this trend to continue in 2026, along with an increase in non-SOL majors being traded on the 
chain.

Solana DEX volume had the greatest start to a year any chain had ever seen. During the TRUMP launch, DEXs handled over $36 billion in 
volume, equivalent to roughly 10% of the daily volume on the NASDAQ. Shortly thereafter, volumes fell rapidly due to a decline in memecoin 
volume and the broader market selloﬀ in April. Since then, there has been a steady increase in DEX volume mainly driven by the emergence of 
prop AMMs, like HumidiFi and Tessera. 
               
 


---

## Page 126

125 
 
Prop AMMs, short for proprietary AMMs, saw their ﬁrst iteration with Liﬁnity in 2022, but didn’t start to take oﬀ until 2024 with the launch of 
SolFi by the Ellipsis team. In 2025, volume share from prop AMMs increased from 10% to 50%, with the majority of the volume coming from the 
SOL-USDC pair. There are now seven major prop AMMs on Solana, with Humidiﬁ being the most dominant. Prop AMMs have an inherent 
advantage over traditional AMMs due to their architecture and the dominance of DEX aggregators on Solana. 
The biggest diﬀerence between prop AMMs and traditional AMMs is how liquidity is managed. Instead of holding passive LP positions, prop 
AMMs actively manage their own quotes, with no outside capital (hence its proprietary name). Most prop AMMs don’t have frontends and solely 
rely on order ﬂow from Jupiter, DFlow, or Titan. When a user requests a trade on an aggregator, each liquidity source on the chain competes to 
oﬀer the best price for that swap. 
This is where the prop AMMs truly shine, as each can utilize oracle updates to provide users with the best prices. On Solana, oracle updates are 
cheap from a compute perspective, especially compared to a swap, and because of how blocks are ordered in Jito auctions, these oracle updates 
land at the beginning of the block and provide users with the most up-to-date information. This also allows prop AMMs to be resistant to toxic 
ﬂows, as they have a pseudo-cancel priority and no public order book to trade against. 
               
 


---

## Page 127

126 
 
One of the most exciting developments coming from the prop AMM evolution is that it is bringing price discovery onchain for major assets. 
Historically, all price discovery has occurred on Binance, as the majority of majors volume takes place there. In 2025, HumidiFi did more volume 
on the SOL-USDC pair than all of Binance’s SOL-USD pairs 27 times, and SolFi was able to accomplish this four times. When you combine this 
feat with the fact that prop AMMs helped facilitate price discovery for ORE, and in total, Solana would’ve been the 5th or 6th largest venue to 
trade MON on launch, we expect Solana to lead in facilitating onchain price discovery for SOL once again next year. Solana will be the best place 
to trade SOL, even large orders, and at times it should lead price discovery for new token launches through Wormhole’s new Sunrise product, an 
application that enables assets from other ecosystems to be listed for day one trading on Solana. 
Resurgence of Solana Perp DEXs 
               
 


---

## Page 128

127 
 
Solana has had all-time highs in perp DEX volume over the last three months. However, the ecosystem is still losing to competitors like 
Hyperliquid, Aster, and Lighter. Next year, Solana’s perp DEXs should close that gap, and could even introduce innovative architectures to the 
perp DEX sector. There are four diﬀerent approaches being taken that all have a shot at winning the Solana market and competing with the 
sector’s market leaders: 
● Drift + Jito BAM: Drift has been the go-to platform for many Solana-native leverage traders, but has primarily been used for trading 
longer-tail assets. Jupiter Perps has historically dominated volume, oﬀering only BTC, ETH, and SOL. However, with the launch of Jito 
BAM, Drift can introduce maker priority cancels (a big diﬀerentiator for Hyperliquid) through BAM plugins. Drift is also expected to gain 
from Solana network improvements such as Alpenglow, increased block sizes, and further adoption of Firedancer, which launched in 
October. 
● Bullet: Formerly Zeta Markets, Bullet has spent 2025 redesigning their architecture to become a network extension on Solana. Bullet 
utilizes Solana for settlement and Celestia for data availability, enabling sub-1 millisecond latency on testnet. Bullet’s private mainnet went 
live on December 11 at Solana Breakpoint. 
● Bulk: Bulk is introducing a sidecar implementation for Solana perps by forking the Jito-Agave client, enabling validators to run 
               
 


---

## Page 129

128 
Bulk-Agave. Users’ positions remain on mainnet, but matching occurs through Bulk Tile, which runs on every validator node running 
Bulk-Agave. This architecture separates the order propagation and matching from onchain settlement, allowing for low latency and 
propagation times. Bulk has also stated that they will share 12.5% of revenue with validators running their client. 
● Phoenix Perps: Ellipsis Labs, the team behind Phoenix Spot and SolFi, is now pursuing Phoenix Perps. This implementation is the most 
experimental, as it uses prop AMMs as the liquidity source for its perp DEX. Phoenix Perps plans to bring the beneﬁts of prop AMMs, 
including tighter spreads, deeper books, and more adaptable quoting, to the perp space. Phoenix Perps launched in private beta at Solana 
Breakpoint. 
The perp DEX space on Solana is wide open and has multiple teams capable of competing with market leaders. 2026 will be the year when this 
gap is closed. 
Onchain Capital Formation 
Another Solana sector that we expect to grow in 2026, is onchain capital formation. What pump.fun started as launchpads for memecoins, has 
expanded into launchpads for tokens attached to relevant projects. Currently there are three options for teams launching tokens on Solana that do 
not want to go through a memecoin launchpad: 
● Metaplex Genesis: Launched in July, an audited onchain token oﬀering (OTO) framework integrated with Metaplex’s dominant asset 
standard. 
● MetaDAO’s ICOs: MetaDAO’s ICOs launched in October, starting the wave for ownership coins to fundraise capital in an onchain 
manner. 
● Jupiter Decentralized Token Formation (DTF): Launched in December, an onchain ICO framework with Jup Lock escrow and 
guaranteed Meteora liquidity. 
Ownership Tokens 
Currently, there is a question of what tokenholder rights one gets when purchasing tokens. With recent acquisitions, like Coinbase acquiring 
Vector.fun or Circle acquiring Interop Labs, many called into question whether TNSR or AXL tokenholders beneﬁt at all. Many of these questions 
are likely to be answered once the CLARITY act is signed into law, but until then, the best representation of tokenholder rights is through what 
MetaDAO is calling “Ownership Tokens.” 
When a team ICOs through MetaDAO’s platform, the proceeds are locked in treasuries whose spending is gated by futarchy proposals and 
pre-deﬁned budgets and burn rates, aligning capital deployment with market-evaluated performance. The tokens that these teams issue are legally 
backed by real-world entities and IP rights, tying token ownership to enforceable claims on oﬀchain business value and reducing incentives for 
founders to abandon tokens. 
During the ICO process, teams deﬁne a target raise amount. Investors then deposit USDC into the ICO and allocations are determined by a 
               
 


---

## Page 130

129 
pro-rata model, if that target is surpassed. Project team tokens are unlocked based on performance metrics, like when a token hits a certain market 
cap, or when decided through decision market proposals. 
 
To date, seven projects have gone through MetaDAO’s ICO, raising a total of $20 million. We expect this to increase dramatically in 2026 as more 
teams look to raise onchain and provide investors conﬁdence that the token is tied to the success of the project. 
The upcoming ICO for Ranger Finance will be an important one to watch. Previously, MetaDAO’s ICO platform was not compatible with teams 
that have raised from VCs in the past or having users with project points receive a guaranteed ICO allocation. The MetaDAO team is working now 
to tweak their ICO process to include these allocations, which will grow the amount of teams that can raise through their platform. 
MetaDAO is competing with Jupiter DTF and Metaplex Genesis, and also with centralized ICO platforms like Coinbase’s Echo, Legion, and 
Coinlist. We believe that MetaDAO is in the best position going forward due to its commitment on focusing on investor protections and

tokenholder rights. In 2026 we expect to see many teams raise through their platform, which could spur natural demand for these tokens due to 
increased tokenholder guarantees.

Enterprise Chains 
Authors: Matt Kreiser, Youssef Haidar, Alice Hou, and Austin Weiler 
XRPL 
What Went Right in 2025 
Market Performance 
 
XRP has maintained more than 4x gains it realized in Q4 2024, as its price has increased 6% year-to-date to $2.2, outperforming BTC (-3% YTD)

131 
and ETH (-10% YTD). Moreover, XRP’s circulating market cap is up 11% YTD from $119.44 billion to $132.90 billion, as the asset maintained 
its position as the 4th largest cryptocurrency by market cap after BTC, ETH, and USDT. 
Following the election of Donald Trump in November 2024, major catalysts in 2025 included the dismissal of appeals of the SEC’s lawsuit against 
Ripple in August and the listing of spot XRP ETFs on U.S. equity markets in November. The dismissal of appeals made SDNY U.S. District 
Judge Analisa Torres' July 2023 ruling that Ripple’s programmatic sales of XRP to retail exchanges did not violate federal securities laws, but that 
its institutional sales did, the unappealed ﬁnal judgment for the case. XRP spot ETFs have seen nearly $1 billion in net ﬂows, providing another 
avenue of buy pressure alongside XRP’s strong retail ﬂows and institutional partners. 
Stablecoins and RWAs 
Stablecoins and RWA adoption on the XRPL increased signiﬁcantly in 2025. 
 
The market cap of Ripple USD (RLUSD) on the XRPL increased 11x year-to-date from $19.6 million to $235.0 million. Historically, stablecoins 
on XRPL have not had the level of adoption of major stablecoins on other networks. For example, Ethereum, TRON, Solana, and BNB Smart

Chain have stablecoin market caps of $172.0 billion, $80.4 billion, $15.2 billion, and $14.1 billion, respectively. For added context, USDT and 
USDC have market caps of $186.3 billion and $78.0 billion across all networks on which they are supported. 
However, in anticipation of increasing regulatory clarity due to the passage of the GENIUS Act in the U.S. on July 18, many stablecoin issuers 
have announced plans to launch, or have launched, stablecoins on the XRPL. Stablecoins launched in 2025 included StraitsX Digital Singapore 
dollar XSGD, euro stablecoin EURØP, Circle’s USDC, Braza Group’s USDB, and Brazilian real stablecoin BBRL. SG-Forge also plans to launch 
a euro stablecoin EURCV. To date, the market cap of these tokens is small, with USDC the second largest after RLUSD at $8.8 million. However, 
collectively they present an increased mix of stablecoin options for XRPL users. 
 
The RWA market cap on the XRPL is up 40x YTD from $5.1 million to $207.9 million as RWA oﬀerings have expanded beyond the tokenized 
short-term U.S. treasuries product TBILL to tokenized stock of market infrastructure service provider Montis Group Limited (MGL), Ondo’s 
short-term tokenized U.S. Treasury fund (OUSG), Guggenheim’s ﬁxed-income asset secured by US Treasuries (DCP), and abrdn’s short-term

tokenized treasury fund (AAULF). This ﬁrst phase of expansion has been largely driven by partnerships with Ripple. Adoption beyond these 
business development deals will hinge on institutions preferring the XRPL’s design choices and features over those of competitor chains. 
2026 Outlook 
Ripple is positioning the XRPL for institutional DeFi adoption as necessary identity, ﬁnancial, compliance, and privacy features are being 
implemented at the network level. These include multipurpose tokens (MPTs) for metadata to store RWA parameters, conﬁdential MPTs using 
Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), and credentials to control access via KYC/AML. These continued updates to make DeFi regulatorily compliant 
at the network’s base level make the XRPL increasingly attractive for institutions, providing default composability for all regulatorily compliant 
assets, as opposed to permissioned protocols on competitor chains that are by default siloed from one another. 
There are a number of developments on this front upcoming in 2026, including: 
● Conﬁdential MPTs that support privacy-preserving collateral management for token amounts (not the accounts themselves), a requirement 
for institutional adoption use cases like onchain collateral repurchase agreements and ﬁxed-income assets like Treasury bonds. 
● Permissioned Domains: Will allow institutions to require speciﬁc credentials to access their oﬀerings on the XRPL. 
● Permissioned DEX: Only accounts with valid credentials will be able to create or ﬁll orders on a permissioned domain, using the XRPL’s 
native DEX to trade assets. 
● Native Lending Protocol: A native lending and borrowing protocol is under development, utilizing single-asset vaults for crypto assets such 
as XRP, BTC, and ETH. These vaults will use credentials and permissioned domains for access control and support a number of 
compliance features, including account freezing, asset freezing, and clawback. The protocol is intended to oﬀer onchain ﬁxed-term and rate 
loans via oﬀchain underwriting, risk management, third-party custody of collateral, and an insurance fund — a model akin to that 
implemented by Maple Finance. 
Collectively, these features will deﬁne XRPL’s 2026. Organic adoption via mass issuance of regulated assets would validate the XRPL’s value 
proposition of native compliance and DeFi composability. Anything less will leave the chain where it is today, reliant on Foundation and Lab 
entities (in this case, Ripple), competing with other chains’ counterparts in business development deals for niche, regulatorily compliant stablecoin 
and RWA asset issuance, that is only a shell of the composability and capital eﬃciency DeFi at scale can deliver.

Cardano 
What Went Right in 2025 
This year marked the successful activation of the Voltaire era's ﬁnal features, which fundamentally reorganized the network's upgrade and 
maintenance architecture. Cardano reached a critical turning point in September 2025 with the ﬁrst fully community-led elections for the 
Constitutional Committee (CC). By fulﬁlling the long-standing promise of a community-owned chain, the successful transfer of power

134 
demonstrated that Cardano can survive and thrive independently of its founding entities. 
The September election replaced the interim committee controlled by founding entities with a fully community-elected committee, formally 
ending the era of founding entity control over protocol parameters. 
 
A notable highlight for the Cardano ecosystem in 2025 was the growth and diversiﬁcation of its stablecoin market cap. The aggregate stablecoin 
market cap grew by 70%, rising from $23.3 million to $39.6 million YTD. The growth in stablecoin supply provides a critical foundation needed 
to support the complex, high-volume real-world applications expected to drive the next phase of growth in 2026. The market matured from being 
heavily reliant on IUSD (whose supply contracted by 58%) to a healthier, more diverse mix of ﬁat-backed assets (USDM, USDA, USDC) and 
overcollateralized algorithmic options (DJED). 
2026 Outlook 
A key technical catalyst for 2026 is Ouroboros Leios, a major upgrade to the consensus protocol. Cardano’s throughput is bottlenecked by the 
design of its current consensus protocol, Ouroboros Praos. This leaves signiﬁcant hardware capacity unused, limiting transaction speeds. 
               
 


---

## Page 136

135 
Leios removes this limitation, allowing the network to process 1,000TPS. Instead of forcing every transaction into a single, slow line, Leios splits 
them into Input Blocks and Endorser Blocks, which allows the network to process blocks concurrently, increasing throughput. 
 
This captures the underutilized capacity shown in the chart above, raising throughput from 4.4 TxKB/s (shown in red) to nearly 300 TxKB/s 
(shown in green). By removing congestion bottlenecks, Leios enables complex, high-throughput use cases, such as institutional DeFi and 
micropayments, to run smoothly without sacriﬁcing the network's security or decentralization. 
Pentad 
Unveiled by Charles Hoskinson in December 2025, Pentad is a strategic alliance that uniﬁes the ecosystem’s ﬁve previously siloed core 
organizations, the Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, IOG, Midnight Foundation, and Intersect, into a single executive layer. 
The alliance’s immediate priority is eliminating the "island eﬀect" that has historically isolated Cardano’s economy. Pentad is focused on three 
pillars:

## Page 137

136 
● Integrating Critical Infrastructure: To ensure adequate liquidity and support DeFi activity, Pentad is prioritizing integrations with 
cross-chain bridges, custodians, and stablecoin issuers. This eﬀort kicks oﬀ in early 2026 with the integration of Pyth Lazer, a low-latency 
oracle designed to support institutional-grade trading speeds. 
● Onboarding Institutions: Pentad provides a single "front door" for the ecosystem, streamlining the negotiation process to match the tempo 
of corporate partners. This consolidation eliminates the friction of the previous era, where potential partners faced a fragmented web of 
entities lacking executive authority. 
● Kingmaking Applications: Moving away from the previous strategy of broad experimentation (which spread small grants across 
thousands of unproven projects), Pentad will concentrate resources on 10 to 15 breakout applications. This "venture-style" approach is 
designed to provide the funding and operational support needed to drive these apps toward proﬁtability and tier-one exchange listings.

Stellar 
What Went Right in 2025 
               
 


---

## Page 138

137 
 
Stellar’s real-world asset (RWA) market cap has increased 114% year-to-date (YTD) from $301.1 million to $643.9 million. The majority of this 
expansion came from BENJI, Franklin Templeton’s tokenized U.S. Treasury fund, which was the ﬁrst regulated money market fund on a 
blockchain when it launched on Stellar in April 2021. But the real story in 2025 was the expansion of RWAs on Stellar beyond BENJI to realize a 
fully mature RWA oﬀering that now includes U.S. Treasuries products like Ondo’s USDY and Spiko’s USTBL, non-U.S. debt in emerging 
markets from Etherfuse, real estate from RedSwan, and equity funds, corporate bonds, alternative institutional funds, and commodities from 
issuers such as WisdomTree and Mercado Bitcoin. 
Historically, these regulatorily compliant RWAs have been reduced to little more than a marketing gimmick providing onchain public accounting 
because they are not freely transferable, and therefore not composable within DeFi. As such, they cannot even begin to oﬀer DeFi’s core value 
proposition of greater composability and capital eﬃciency compared to their TradFi equivalents. But on Stellar, this is beginning to change with 
the launch of freely transferable RWA’s from Centrifuge and Etherfuse that can be used on overcollateralized lending and borrowing protocols like 
Blend. 
With the ﬁfth most RWAs distributed by marketcap, Stellar is a serious contender among networks vying to lead RWA issuance and is an eﬃcient

## Page 139

138 
platform for institutions and retail users alike to access and interact with RWAs onchain. 
2026 Outlook 
As an L1 built to service everyday ﬁnancial use cases, Stellar’s 2026 will depend on growth in the network’s stablecoin adoption, payments, DeFi 
protocols, and RWAs. 
The vast majority of stablecoin issuance is currently on Ethereum, TRON, Solana, and BNB Chain. As a challenger to these incumbents, Stellar 
must continue to validate its near-zero transaction costs (average transaction fee of $0.00055 in Q3’25) and purpose-built products, tools, and 
applications for payments. These include more than 50 wallet applications, a global network of on and oﬀ-ramps (Anchors), and the Stellar 
Disbursements Platform (SDP), a turnkey solution for sending digital payments to many individuals for purposes such as humanitarian aid, 
micropayments, global payroll, and international creator and vendor payouts. Increased use of payment applications for purposes such as 
remittances, consumer, and B2B will also be crucial, as will increased adoption of payment ﬁnancing (PayFi) for cross-border institutional-scale 
settlement, an existing area of strength for the network. 
On the DeFi front, strong momentum from 2025 should carry into 2026. Stellar’s DeFi total-value locked has increased 4x year-to-date from 
$49.7 million to $197.1 million. In May, the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) set a goal for Stellar to have a top 10 DeFi TVL, which would 
require $1.8 billion in TVL. After smart contracts went live on Stellar in 2024 with the release of Soroban, 2025 was the year of building out 
Stellar’s basic DeFi ecosystem and adoption. 2026, then, will be a year for Stellar to grow DeFi adoption by an order of magnitude to reach the 
top 10 DeFi TVL goal, while scaling stablecoin and payments adoption to the next wave of users. Realizing the DeFi TVL growth goal will 
require onboarding new and existing blue chip DeFi protocols and tier-1 partnerships to lock in larger deposits. It may also require incentive 
campaigns, which have historically been risky, as deposits are not sustained after the incentive campaign ends.

Hedera 
What Went Right in 2025 
Hedera’s DeFi activity strengthened in 2025, with clear gains across both trading activity and stablecoin liquidity. Average daily DEX volume 
increased 65% YoY, rising from $5.9 million to $9.8 million, with activity heavily concentrated on SaucerSwap, Hedera’s core DEX. 
Stablecoins also had a large shift. Average stablecoin market cap climbed from $11.6 million in 2024 to $93.4 million in 2025, in part due to 
Hedera’s Q2 integration of Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP). By enabling native USDC transfers from Ethereum to Hedera without 
third-party bridges, CCTP improved capital mobility into the ecosystem and supported the year’s stablecoin expansion. 
               
 


---

## Page 140

139 
 
In 2025, Hedera continued to lean into institutional and public-sector adoption through regulated RWA integrations. In August, KAIO launched 
tokenized institutional fund access on Hedera for accredited and institutional investors, bringing strategies such as the Laser Digital Carry Fund, 
BlackRock ICS U.S. Dollar Liquidity Fund, and Brevan Howard Master Fund onto Hedera’s onchain rails. 
In September, the Wyoming Stable Token Commission selected Hedera as the only additional blockchain candidate for Wyoming’s Frontier Stable 
Token (FRNT), a state-issued stable token backed by dollars and Treasuries. 
2026 Outlook 
Hedera’s 2026 growth narrative centers on transforming the network into a backbone for regulated enterprise infrastructure. This evolution is 
driven by two reinforcing verticals: RWA tokenization and veriﬁable AI. By focusing on institutional utility, Hedera is positioning itself to capture 
recurring, high-volume demand within the global digital economy. 
The ﬁrst vertical, RWA tokenization, reimagines onchain settlement for national and institutional use cases. Rather than treating tokens as mere 
digital certiﬁcates, Hedera provides a robust ecosystem for the entire asset lifecycle. National-scale projects, such as Georgia’s real estate registry 
migration, leverage the network to replace manual veriﬁcation with near-instant settlement. This shift is supported by Asset Tokenization Studio,

## Page 141

140 
which automates the complex legal and technical requirements of issuing digital securities, and Stablecoin Studio, which enables the 
programmable, regulated liquidity necessary to settle these transactions at scale. 
The second vertical, veriﬁable AI, introduces a trust layer for systems that require transparent and auditable computation. Partnerships with Intel, 
NVIDIA, and EQTY Lab embed cryptographic attestations at the hardware level. AI operations on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs and Intel processors 
generate hardware-signed proofs that are recorded on the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS), creating an immutable audit trail. For example, a 
bank running an AI model to assess loan risk can produce a veriﬁable record of the model version, inputs, and outputs, allowing auditors to 
conﬁrm that decisions were generated by approved systems and not altered after the fact. 
As these eﬀorts transition into live, working deployments in 2026, Hedera’s growth narrative shifts from ecosystem experimentation to 
infrastructure adoption within regulated enterprises. This creates a clearer path to sustained network demand, driven by real settlement volume 
from RWAs and veriﬁable records for high-stakes AI systems. 
Algorand 
2025 Recap 
Staked ALGO Increase 
               
 


---

## Page 142

141 
 
A standout success for Algorand in 2025 was its increase in community staking participation following its v4.0 upgrade on Jan. 23, which enabled 
ALGO rewards for proposing blocks and wallets to delegate stake to third-party node operators. Year-to-date, total staked ALGO increased 5% 
from 1.26 billion to 1.95 billion, while community-staked ALGO rose 239% from 460.7 million to 1.56 billion. Algorand’s 2025 staking growth 
shows that reducing staking barriers and oﬀering clear incentives can boost user participation, a design worth replicating for chains struggling with 
staking participation. 
DeFi TVL Decrease 
               
 


---

## Page 143

142 
 
A key challenge for Algorand in 2025 was its sharp decline in DeFi TVL, which fell 65% from $137.6 million to $48.6 million. Throughout 2025, 
DeFi TVL remained heavily concentrated on two protocols: Folks Finance, a lending protocol with a 74% share ($35.8 million), and Tinyman, an 
AMM DEX with an 18% share ($8.8 million). 
TVL bottomed at $31.6 million on June 17 before rebounding 55% by November 30, oﬀering a modest sign of stability. However, no new 
protocols meaningfully contributed to TVL in 2025, and without diversiﬁcation, Algorand’s DeFi ecosystem, fee generation, and usage will 
remain tied to the performance of two protocols, limiting its ability to scale sustainably. 
2026 Outlook 
Algorand enters 2026 needing to expand DeFi TVL beyond Folks Finance and Tinyman. To do so, it must oﬀer stronger incentives for developers 
to launch new protocols that bring fresh capital onchain. The Foundation made early moves in this direction in 2025 by hosting ﬁve in-person 
developer events and launching the Algorand Startup Challenges, a six-week incubator with a $125,000 USDC prize pool, the largest of any 
Foundation-run hackathon to date. These initiatives marked a shift toward more competitive incentivization, but converting developer momentum 
into TVL growth remains the key challenge. Algorand’s success in 2026 will depend on its ability to attract capital across a broader set of

Monolithic Chains 
Authors: Alexander Beaudry, Jeremy Koch, AJC, Jake Koch-Gallup, Matt Kreiser, Patryk Krasnicki, Matthew Nay, and Youssef Haidar 
BNB Chain 
BNB Chain cemented its position as the third-most-used blockchain in 2025, trailing only Ethereum and Solana in real adoption metrics. The 
network crossed 58 million monthly active addresses in September, overtaking Solana's 38.3 million, while daily active users consistently 
exceeded two million throughout the year. This wasn't driven by a single narrative but by broad-based ecosystem growth across DeFi, memecoins, 
and payments, all of which found a home on BNB Chain this year. 
 
               
 


---

## Page 145

144 
BNB Chain accounted for over 40% of global DEX trading volume, with $178 billion in monthly volume as of May. On May 26, trading volume 
on BNB Chain DEXs reached $13.31 billion, which was 7.9 times higher than Ethereum's $1.675 billion and 5.7 times greater than Solana's $2.32 
billion. PancakeSwap processed $420.45 billion in trading volume during the ﬁrst half of 2025 alone, while perpetuals activity surged to record 
levels when Aster launched its token on September 17, oﬀering 1,001x leverage and yield-bearing collateral through Lista DAO's liquid staking 
products. 
The memecoin narrative also returned in October after CZ's "BNB meme szn" post. Four.meme, a major launchpad on BNB Chain, brieﬂy 
surpassed Solana's Pump.fun in daily revenue, hitting $4.2 million in 24-hour fees on October 8. While Four.meme's revenue declined 89% from 
October to November as memecoin activity normalized, the platform's earlier success demonstrated that BNB Chain could capture speculative 
retail ﬂows at scale when momentum shifted in its direction. 
What made all of this possible were two critical network upgrades that transformed BNB Chain's execution environment. The Lorentz Hardfork 
on April 29 and Maxwell Hardfork on June 30 reduced block times from 3 seconds to 0.75 seconds, making BNB one of the fastest EVM chains 
in production. Transaction fees decreased by 98% to 0.05 Gwei, or approximately $0.005 per transaction. These improvements created the 
infrastructure for sustained high-frequency activity without degrading user experience, enabling BNB Chain to reliably support billions of dollars 
in daily DEX volume and millions of daily users. 
The year's biggest strategic advantage, however, was Binance's active role in directing traﬃc to BNB Chain. Binance Alpha, launched in 
December 2024, became a pre-listing showcase for early-stage tokens, and 71% of the ﬁrst wave of admitted tokens chose BNB Chain as their 
home network. The Alpha program created a gamiﬁed incentive structure where users earned points by holding assets on Binance and trading 
Alpha-listed tokens, with double points awarded for trades executed on BNB Chain via Binance Wallet. This structure funneled liquidity directly 
into BNB Chain's DEXs. BNB Chain recorded over one million new addresses daily linked to Alpha-related activity, while weekly transactions 
increased 60% and weekly trading volume climbed 115% during the initial Alpha rollout period.

## Page 146

145 
 
BNB reached its all-time high at $1,373 on October 13 with a market cap of $180 billion, which put it at #3 among all crypto assets, excluding 
stablecoins, where it remained for the rest of the year. DeFi TVL increased roughly 32% year-to-date to reach $7.9 billion by November 30, while 
stablecoin supply on BNB Chain doubled to $14 billion, growing 102.9% from $6.9 billion at the beginning of the year. 
2026 Outlook 
BNB Chain enters 2026 with one major advantage: direct distribution through Binance's 290 million user base. The Binance Alpha program will 
remain central to BNB Chain's growth strategy, serving as a pipeline that funnels early-stage tokens, liquidity, and new users onto the network 
before those projects reach broader visibility. With trading competitions, point multipliers for BNB Chain transactions, and preferential treatment 
for tokens that launch on BSC, Binance has eﬀectively turned its exchange into a continuous onboarding mechanism for BNB Chain. This 
structural advantage is diﬃcult for competing chains to replicate and positions BNB Chain to capture a disproportionate share of new token 
launches and speculative retail activity in 2026. 
On the infrastructure side, the BNB Chain’s Fermi upgrade, scheduled to reach mainnet in 2026, will reduce block times to 0.45 seconds on BSC, 
targeting 40% faster transaction processing while introducing EVM optimizations and incremental state snapshots. If executed smoothly, BNB

## Page 147

146 
Chain should be capable of 20,000 TPS by mid-2026 with sub-150 millisecond conﬁrmations. These improvements will expand BNB Chain's 
capacity to handle sustained high-frequency activity, particularly as perpetuals trading continues to scale and as more consumer-facing 
applications migrate to the network. 
DeFi growth in 2026 will likely concentrate around Lista DAO's lisBNB product and its integrations with Aster, PancakeSwap's lending protocols, 
and Venus Core Pool. Lista's TVL surpassed $2.85 billion in 2025, making it the third-largest protocol on BNB Chain. Lista Lending was 
launched on April 7 with $189 million in deposits within four days. The protocol became the ﬁrst to integrate World Liberty Financial's USD1 
stablecoin on BNB Chain and added mXRP, Midas's liquid-staking token for XRP, in November. If TVL continues to grow and lisBNB becomes 
standard collateral for margin trading and lending, it creates demand for BNB independent of price speculation and deepens the liquidity available 
for leveraged strategies on platforms like Aster. 
BNB Chain is also pushing into Real-World Assets. The network launched a dedicated RWA incentive program on May 29 and signed 
partnerships spanning tokenized treasuries, private credit, and real estate. Projects like Avalon Finance, OpenEden, and Matrixdock have already 
deployed yield-bearing instruments backed by oﬀchain collateral, and BNB will likely continue to push similar initiatives. 
If the Fermi upgrade lands cleanly, RWA projects continue to scale, and Binance Alpha maintains its momentum as a distribution engine, BNB 
Chain will solidify its role as the default execution layer for retail-focused DeFi, high-frequency trading, and new token launches. The network's 
combination of low fees, fast execution, and privileged access to Binance's user base creates a structural advantage that competing chains cannot 
easily counter, positioning BNB Chain for sustained growth through 2026 and beyond. 
TRON 
What Went Right in 2025 
This past year, TRON reached all-time highs in multiple areas. There have been more than 3.2 billion transactions (1.9 billion of which were free 
transactions), 2.5 million average daily active addresses, $79.36 billion in stablecoin supply, and onchain activity that generated $548.2 million in 
chain fees, the third most of any chain in 2025.

Chain fees have declined noticeably since September, but for good reason. On August 29, Proposal 104 was passed, lowering transaction fees by 
reducing the energy unit price by more than half, from 0.00021 TRX to 0.0001 TRX. With the stablecoin supercycle looming, TRON is 
prioritizing future growth over maximizing monetization of current platform usage, ensuring that cost-sensitive USDT users are not priced oﬀ the 
network. 
               
 


---

## Page 149

148 
 
Speaking of USDT, TRON has ﬁrmly established itself as one of the leading stablecoin settlement layers, anchored by its outsized share of USDT 
supply. TRON maintains a consistently large USDT base of $78.15 billion, representing 42% of total USDT in circulation. USDT on TRON also 
exhibits high turnover, with daily transfer volumes frequently exceeding $20-30 billion. 
This combination of scale, velocity, and consistency helps explain why TRON remains a preferred venue for global remittances, market-making 
ﬂows, and stablecoin-driven commerce. With stablecoin activity serving as a strong proxy for real economic usage, TRON’s performance 
positions it not just as a major blockchain, but as one of the core ﬁnancial rails underpinning the digital dollar ecosystem. 
2026 Outlook 
TRON is deﬁnitively one of the strongest businesses in crypto, and one of the few that can claim annualized revenues north of half a billion 
dollars. That success has not gone unnoticed. Over the past year, stablechains, purpose-built blockchains optimized speciﬁcally for stablecoin 
usage, have emerged as one of the most crowded and highly anticipated narratives in the market. These chains are explicitly designed to compete 
with TRON’s core use case: serving as the primary settlement layer for USDT. 
While expectations for some of these stablechain competitors are high, TRON’s moat should not be understated. Lower transaction fees, which

149 
will likely be the primary advantage stablechains oﬀer, are rarely suﬃcient on their own to meaningfully change user behavior. For the marginal 
stablecoin user, what matters more is global distribution, reliable on- and oﬀ-ramps, and deep integration across exchanges, payment processors, 
merchants, and informal ﬁnancial networks. TRON’s years-long head start in distribution and integration creates a moat that newer stablechains 
will struggle to close. As a result, stablechains are perhaps better positioned to attract net-new stablecoin users and use cases rather than attempt to 
displace TRON. 
Ultimately, TRON’s challenge is not to reinvent itself, but to continue building on this distribution advantage while expanding its global footprint. 
Delivering technical upgrades that (i) optimize fees, (ii) enhance scalability and resilience, and (iii) enable fast ﬁnality and parallel execution, 
alongside continued improvements to its EVM compatibility, will be essential to retaining developers and users. If TRON can maintain its USDT 
moat while incrementally expanding its capabilities, it is well-positioned to remain a cornerstone of the global stablecoin economy in 2026. 
Sui 
What Went Right in 2025 
One of Sui’s most notable achievements in 2025 was the acceleration of onchain trading activity across AMMs, CLMMs, perpetuals, and 
orderbook venues. Rising average daily DEX volume became the clearest signal that Sui’s execution model was translating into sustained 
economic throughput. The network entered the year at $268.3 million in average daily DEX volume and expanded steadily: $305.2 million in Q1, 
$367.9 million in Q2, and $456.0 million in Q3. Momentum continued into year-end, with average daily volume reaching $557.3 million across 
October and November, supported by deeper liquidity, broader user participation, and the simultaneous growth of multiple trading venues. 
               
 


---

## Page 151

150 
 
Activity during this period was distributed across the ecosystem rather than concentrated in a single protocol. Momentum recorded $255.4 million 
in average daily volume, followed by Cetus at $87.1 million, Blueﬁn at $80.5 million, Magma at $49 million, and DeepBook at $42.2 million, 
with an additional $45 million generated by other protocols. The distribution reﬂected a structurally diversiﬁed trading ecosystem, with volume 
split across spot AMMs, CLMMs, perpetuals, and orderbook-based liquidity rather than converging on a single dominant design. 
DeFi liquidity trends reinforced this expansion. Sui’s TVL reached a high of $2.64 billion in October 2025, signaling broader capital formation 
across lending, derivatives, and BTC-backed collateral, even as levels retraced later in the quarter. 
Protocol-level execution and product improvements helped sustain the increase in trading volume. Momentum surpassed 1.3 million users and $7 
billion in cumulative volume within months of launch. Blueﬁn introduced Blueﬁn Pro, adding a new margining engine and native USDC support. 
DeepBook expanded into margin trading and nearly tripled cumulative volume. 
Sui’s underlying infrastructure enabled low-cost, high-throughput trading across venues. Average transaction costs stayed below one cent, 32% of 
all transactions were sponsored, and core developer tools improved meaningfully through new passkey authentication, MPC wallet integrations,

151 
and the expansion of Walrus, Seal, Nautilus, and Ika. 
By the end of 2025, Sui demonstrated that its performance advantages could sustain real economic activity at scale. Liquidity broadened, DEX 
volumes climbed, and the network consistently delivered predictable, low-latency execution across a diverse mix of trading venues. The next 
phase of growth will depend on how eﬀectively Sui uniﬁes its expanding infrastructure stack into a cohesive platform. 
2026 Outlook 
 
Sui enters 2026 with the opportunity to evolve from a high-performance execution environment into a cohesive full-stack platform. Over the past 
two years, the network has assembled a broad set of capabilities spanning onboarding, identity, storage, compute, liquidity, and cross-chain 
coordination. The strategic question for 2026 is whether these components can operate as a uniﬁed surface that lowers development friction and 
enables applications to compose functionality natively rather than integrate disparate protocols. If 2025 showed that Sui can support real economic 
               
 


---

## Page 153

152 
activity at scale, 2026 will test whether the Sui Stack can turn those capabilities into a coherent platform for builders. 
A number of Sui’s primitives already push in this direction. Sponsored transactions, zkLogin, and Passkey support give developers tools to 
minimize onboarding friction and oﬀer authentication patterns familiar to mainstream users. On the liquidity side, DeepBook provides a uniﬁed 
orderbook layer supporting AMMs, CLMMs, aggregators, and derivatives platforms, while the Sui Bridge and Ika introduce native cross-chain 
movement and MPC-based coordination. 
Storage, compute, and privacy primitives deepen this foundation. Walrus oﬀers decentralized blob storage for large assets, Nautilus enables 
veriﬁable oﬀchain computation through trusted execution environments, and Seal provides encrypted access control for sensitive data. 
Higher-level components such as Sui Kiosk and the Sui Stack Messaging SDK simplify commerce ﬂows, asset management, and application-level 
communication. 
In the base case, 2026 will be deﬁned by increasing cohesion across these layers. Developer activity should grow as integration friction declines 
and stack primitives mature into a more coherent platform. Liquidity is becoming more uniﬁed through DeepBook integrations and improved 
routing, supporting both spot and derivatives markets. Apps in AI, commerce, gaming, and data services will deploy production versions that use 
Walrus, Seal, and Nautilus for storage, privacy, and compute. Taken together, these trends support steady ecosystem growth, broader usage of Sui’s 
primitives, and a more diverse distribution of onchain activity.

Aptos 
What Went Right in 2025

Aptos’s stablecoin market cap has increased 114% year-to-date (YTD) from $627.8 million to $1.51 billion. Native USDC, USDT, and BUIDL 
contracts were launched on the network in October and November 2024, paving the way for market cap growth in 2025. World Liberty Financial’s 
USD1 also launched in October 2025. Together, these stablecoins enabled Aptos’s record stablecoin transfer volume, which grew 5.6x from $8.6 
billion in the month of January to $48.4 billion in November. Additionally, LayerZero’s omnichain interoperability framework made Paxos’s 
Global Dollar Stablecoin (USDG) available in November and PayPal’s PYUSD in September, while bridged token contracts for Ethena’s USDe 
and sUSDE were launched on Aptos in February. As Aptos moves towards technically realizing its vision of becoming “the global trading 
engine,” stablecoin usage is a leading area of growth and adoption. 
2026 Outlook 
In a future where all assets are tokenized and tradable onchain, capital markets operate 24/7 without intermediaries, and access is permissionless, 
Aptos’s goal is to become the global trading engine. Technical capacity and adoption are the two variables Aptos Labs and the Aptos Foundation 
need to solve for to reach this goal.

Technical Capacity 
Aptos is already one of the most performant L1 blockchains, but will look to scale even further in 2026. Median block times are now 60ms as 
more than 97% of validators have adopted the Velociraptr upgrade, which reduced block times by 40%. Building on Velociraptr, block times will 
scale even further to 10ms via Archon’s architecture. In the context of ﬁnancial markets, this will allow market makers to quote tighter, manage 
orders more eﬃciently leading to better pricing, trade nearly instantaneously, and reduce time between order book matches. 
Further upgrades to reduce latency and boost throughput on Aptos include the Block-STM V2 upgrade, improving upon Block-STM dynamic 
parallel execution to enable thousands of complex transactions to run simultaneously. Zaptos will optimize Aptos’ execution further via optimistic 
execution and commitment, while Shardines will introduce a horizontally scaled execution engine to process partitions of transactions in parallel 
across multiple nodes. In testing, this approach has already enabled Aptos to achieve one million TPS with 30 shards. Finally, encrypted 
mempools will keep transaction details hidden until block inclusion, preventing frontrunning, and ensuring conﬁdentiality for traders. 
Adoption 
Decibel and Shelby are the two main products being developed to drive adoption on Aptos under its global trading vision. 
Now in testnet, Decibel is a fully onchain permissionless trading engine that uniﬁes spot, perps, and margin into a single programmable, global 
platform. Anticipated to go live Q1 2026, Decibel delivers the performance of centralized exchanges with the transparency, control, and 
composability of DeFi. 
Co-developed by Aptos Labs and Jump Crypto, Shelby is a cloud-grade hot storage protocol for data availability. Currently in Devnet, Shelby is 
designed to deliver Web2-grade low-latency with sub-second reads and high-throughput storage suitable for real-time, read-intensive Web3 
applications for content streaming, AI inference and real-time applications. Shelby’s coordination and settlement is on Aptos, though the 
underlying storage functionality is chain-agnostic. The protocol runs via nodes connected by a ﬁber-optic network that will be rewarded in 
real-time for providing data.

Sei 
What Went Right in 2025 
Sei had an incredible year with consistent growth across key metrics, the ﬁrst ecosystem token launches, and partnerships with core infrastructure 
providers. Network activity has grown for ﬁve straight quarters, largely led by what is now a leading gaming ecosystem in crypto. Average daily 
active addresses (DAAs) and average daily transactions are at all-time highs, led by games like World of Dypians, Sugar Senpai, and Idle Glory.

## Page 156

Growth wasn’t limited to gaming. Sei’s DeFi ecosystem had an equally strong year with TVL, spot trading volume, and stablecoin market cap 
continually reaching new all-time highs throughout 2025 while ecosystem tokens of leading DeFi protocols like DragonSwap (DRG) and Yei 
Finance (CLO) launched in July and October. Spot trading volume in particular was a standout, with cumulative spot trading volume reaching 
$9.47 billion. Sei is on track to surpass $10 billion in spot trading volume in 2025, which should mark more than 400% YoY growth relative to the 
$2.66 billion facilitated in 2024. 
As for token price, SEI’s performance hasn’t matched the performance of the network’s fundamentals, as price has dropped 69% YTD from $0.42 
to $0.13. That said, the token’s circulating market cap rank stayed relatively ﬂat going from 65th to 69th, indicating the token performed in line 
with the broader market. 
Looking ahead, onchain central limit order books (CLOBs) are emerging on Sei, bringing more optimal architecture for capital eﬃciency, price 
discovery, and scalability. Citrex Markets and Oxium have launched, but the most signiﬁcant is still to come. Monaco Protocol is a perpetual 
futures exchange being incubated by Sei Labs. With Sei’s Giga upgrade looming, the network is primed to return to its roots by creating a 
next-gen CLOB to compete with Hyperliquid. 
2026 Outlook

Despite a momentous 2025, Sei’s DeFi ecosystem was negatively impacted by the defaults of Stream Finance and Elixir in early November, 
which caused similar eﬀects across other ecosystems. The network’s TVL and stablecoin market cap halved in the days that followed, ending a 
great year on a sour note. Sei will need to rebound via asset inﬂows and continued excitement to use its DeFi protocols in 2026. Sei can lean on 
the host of partnerships it secured this year for increased distribution, including native USDC, integrations with Backpack Wallet and Metamask, 
and upcoming launches of PYUSD, AUSD, and USDY. 
On the technical side, Sei Labs will be key to 2026. Development of Sei’s next major upgrade, Giga, is well underway. The upgrade hopes to oﬀer 
a 50x improvement in throughput over other EVM-compatible networks by reaching a maximum capacity of ﬁve gigagas per second. This level of 
performance would be achieved by revamped execution, consensus (Autobahn), and storage, as well as the ﬁrst-ever instance of multiple 
concurrent proposers on an EVM L1, allowing multiple validators to propose transactions simultaneously. 
Giga will enable new use cases, such as that of Monaco Protocol. With leadership from Jayendra Jog, Co-founder of Sei and former Software 
Engineer at Robinhood, and Simranjeet Singh, CEO and Co-founder of Monaco Protocol and former Head of DeFi Trading at GSR, Sei has a 
clear catalyst for increased DeFi activity in 2026 via Monaco Protocol.

Flow 
What Went Right in 2025 
Widely regarded as the most signiﬁcant technical milestone in the network’s history, Forte advanced Flow beyond its reputation as a consumer 
blockchain into high-performance, general-purpose infrastructure capable of supporting complex institutional ﬁnance and automated agentic 
workﬂows. 
The upgrade introduced scheduled transactions, a protocol-native “cron job” enabling automated DeFi strategies without oﬀchain dependencies. 
Simultaneously, native WebAuthn and Passkey support replaced the need for seed phrases with biometric authentication, enabling native mobile 
onboarding through device-backed credentials.

## Page 158

157 
 
A standout success for Flow in 2025 was the explosive expansion of its DeFi ecosystem, where TVL surged 185% from $37.5 million to $106.9 
million. 
This was driven by a structural maturity in DeFi markets, which evolved beyond swaps to support more complex and creative DeFi primitives, 
such as MORE Markets’ omnichain vaults and KittyPunch’s decentralized volatility index protocol, enabling users to earn yield from the price 
changes of Flow EVM assets. Both protocols incentivized TVL by oﬀering high APRs on bridged PYUSD (USDF) pools. 
By successfully bootstrapping a layer of complex, yield-bearing infrastructure, Flow has established the necessary ﬁnancial infrastructure to 
support the strategic push towards Consumer DeFi. 
2026 Outlook 
DeFi has had a highly technical barrier to entry and is historically fraught with risk, ranging from exploits to liquidations. This has hindered 
adoption among non-crypto natives. In 2026, Flow is focused on bridging the gap between consumer ﬁnance and DeFi with the launch of Flow 
Credit Markets (FCM), a lending protocol enabling mainstream users to leverage high DeFi yields while mitigating liquidations and smart contract 
risk. 
               
 


---

## Page 159

158 
Dapper Labs is commercializing Flow’s infrastructure with Peak Money, a mobile wallet built on top of the FCM. By abstracting away seed 
phrases and technical hurdles, the app repackages DeFi transactions into a simple, “deﬁbank” interface, addressing the usability concerns that 
have long restricted crypto to niche audiences. 
 
Beyond the app itself, Peak Money establishes a new operational standard for the Flow ecosystem: 
1. The Foundation builds the permanent, enshrined utility. 
2. Strategic Partners launch applications to commercialize the utility. 
3. The Community inherits a robust, liquid foundation with a sustainable revenue model. 
By hardening ﬁnancial primitives such as FCM directly into the protocol, rather than relying on third-party contracts, Flow is vertically integrating 
to become an active infrastructure provider. This is powerful because apps no longer need to bootstrap their own security or liquidity. Instead, they 
inherit a uniﬁed, secure standard instantly, allowing them to focus entirely on distribution and user acquisition while Flow handles the "heavy 
lifting." 
The enshrinement of FCM transforms the protocol’s business model by monetizing automation. Because the FCM relies on the onchain scheduler 
to constantly rebalance portfolios and compound yields, it generates a high baseline of transactions. Once these automated strategies push the 
network past ~250 TPS, the fees burned are designed to exceed new issuance, making FLOW net deﬂationary. This directly links the protocol's 
activity to the token's value, creating a self-sustaining economic engine.

Monad 
What Went Right in 2025 
 
On November 24, 2025, Monad launched its mainnet after three years of development. Monad raised $244 million since its ﬁrst round in February 
2023, before raising an additional $187.5 million through Coinbase’s new ICO mechanism in the week leading up to TGE. The MON token serves 
as the native currency of Monad, enabling transaction fee payments and staking to secure the network. At mainnet launch, MON’s total initial 
supply was set at 100 billion tokens, of which 7.5% was oﬀered during the ICO at a $2.5 billion valuation. There was demand for the token, with 
the sale being 1.47 times oversubscribed as Coinbase users committed over $276 million in just a ﬁve-day period. 
One of the most interesting aspects of Monad’s launch is the size of its ecosystem. There were 74 apps live on day one, including blue chip apps 
like Uniswap, Curve, Morpho, alongside many Monad-native apps. Today, that number has grown to over 100. 
2026 Outlook 
               
 


---

## Page 161

160 
In 2026, Monad could quietly show that there is still demand for new blockspace, especially EVM-compatible blockspace with 
faster-than-Ethereum block times that does not sacriﬁce on decentralization. In less than a month, Monad has accumulated over $400 million in 
stablecoins on its network and over $200 million in TVL. 
Two sectors on Monad that are primed for success in 2026 are DeFi and consumer. In DeFi, Monad oﬀers Kuru, an onchain spot CLOB, and 
Perpl, a perpetuals DEX hoping to be a category leader. On the consumer side, they have RareBetSports, a daily fantasy sports app, Levr.Bet, a 
leveraged sports betting platform, and Kizzy, a social betting app. 
Monad’s metrics may well trend upwards and by the end of 2026, a healthy ecosystem could solidify on the network.

Avalanche 
What Went Right in 2025 
Avalanche had a pivotal year in 2025, marked by steady institutional momentum and the expansion of regulated ﬁnancial infrastructure across the 
network. The introduction of jurisdiction-backed stablecoins, including Japan’s JPYC, Korea’s KRW1, and Wyoming’s FRNT, showcased 
Avalanche’s growing relevance for compliant payments and settlement. Through these initiatives, Avalanche is positioning itself as a trusted venue 
for day-to-day settlement and cross-border transfers, supported by collaborations with major ﬁnancial institutions such as SMBC in Japan and 
Woori Bank in Korea. Together, these eﬀorts reﬂect a broader strategy to provide national and regional stablecoin issuers with a high-performance 
blockchain environment tailored to regulated payment use cases. 
Institutional engagement also deepened through VanEck’s Purpose Built Fund, which is dedicated to investing in projects across the Avalanche 
ecosystem and reﬂects the growing interest from traditional asset managers in the network’s long-term potential. Together, these developments 
positioned Avalanche as an L1 that was clearly focused in 2025 on advancing its institutional alignment.

This momentum extended into RWAs, where Avalanche emerged as a leading venue for tokenized ﬁnancial products. Deployments from 
BlackRock, VanEck, SkyBridge, and Grove Finance highlighted the growing willingness of established ﬁrms to experiment with onchain credit, 
fund structures, and enterprise-grade settlement. Grove’s $250.0 million onchain credit program and SkyBridge’s tokenization of $300.0 million in 
assets were notable milestones that contributed to Avalanche’s RWA TVL increasing by over 495% in 2025. 
Avalanche also continued to deliver on gaming in 2025. MapleStory N’s arrival on its Henesys L1 drew more than one million users ahead of 
launch, while Pulsar and the GUNZ ecosystem strengthened Avalanche’s reputation as a scalable home for high-throughput gaming. Lastly, 
FIFA’s dedicated chain broadened Avalanche’s footprint in global sports and entertainment. 
2026 Outlook 
Avalanche enters 2026 with several catalysts that can reshape both network performance and token economics. The most consequential is the 
formation of its Digital Asset Treasuries, AVAT and AVAX One, which together target up to $1.70 billion in long-term AVAX accumulation.  
Bitwise, Grayscale, and VanEck each submitted applications for Avalanche-based spot ETF products in 2025. These ﬁlings introduce a potential

new channel for capital inﬂows, and any resolution in 2026 will be important to watch as investors gain clearer access to Avalanche through 
regulated market structures. The coming year shifts the focus from forming institutional relationships to demonstrating how these developments 
can translate into real economic activity onchain. 
Avalanche also enters 2026 with meaningful technical improvements following the Granite upgrade. This enhancement strengthens Avalanche’s 
multi-chain architecture through epoch-based P-Chain views, making Interchain Messaging more predictable and cost-eﬃcient. Although Granite 
was launched late in 2025, its beneﬁts will be felt throughout 2026 as developers adopt these capabilities and Avalanche continues to reﬁne 
performance across its expanding L1 ecosystem. 
Avalanche succeeds in 2026 by translating its institutional groundwork and technical upgrades into deeper liquidity, ecosystem growth, and more 
direct value capture for AVAX. The partnerships, infrastructure, and execution pathways are already in place. This year becomes about deepening 
relationships with the institutions Avalanche is already working with, while strengthening its ties to existing L1s and continuing to provide an 
environment that enables them to scale and attract users. At the same time, Avalanche needs to remain an attractive destination for new protocols 
seeking to launch their own L1s on the network. 
NEAR 
What Went Right in 2025 
NEAR made progress on its long-standing technical vision in 2025, translating years of architectural bets into visible execution. The network 
demonstrated throughput at a scale few L1s can credibly claim, publicly showcasing performance that crossed the one million TPS threshold 
under test conditions. This milestone reinforced the viability of NEAR’s sharded design and async execution model, validating that scalability was 
not merely theoretical but operationally achievable.

NEAR Intents also took shape as a unifying abstraction layer, reframing the user experience around outcomes rather than transactions. NEAR 
Intents has processed over $7 billion in all-time volume. By abstracting away chain-speciﬁc complexity, Intents positioned NEAR as a 
coordination layer capable of routing user intent across chains and services, aligning with broader industry trends toward intent-centric 
architectures. 
On the governance side, NEAR successfully rolled out the House of Stake in 2025. Following a partnership with Gauntlet and Agora, the new 
governance portal went live on mainnet on Aug. 7, 2025. Introducing onchain governance through veNEAR and an endorsed delegate model, the 
House of Stake marked a shift from informal coordination to a more structured and transparent governance process. This helped clarify 
decision-making pathways between token holders, delegates, and the NEAR Foundation, reducing ambiguity around protocol stewardship. 
2026 Outlook 
Looking ahead to 2026, NEAR is positioned to build on its momentum by deepening the real-world use of Intents as a foundational cross-chain 
and agent-native layer that abstracts away blockchain complexity, enabling seamless transactions and interactions across multiple networks and AI 
agents. In 2026, we hope to see the output of the partnership with Stanford Open Lab, exploring how veriﬁable AI agents can eﬀectively assist 
decentralized decision-making while maintaining human oversight. NEAR’s governance is evolving through ongoing AI research with Stanford

OpenLab via the House of Stake, exploring how intelligent systems can assist decentralized decision-making. This collaboration underscores 
NEAR’s ambition not just to scale infrastructure, but to pioneer how AI and Web3 can best combine, laying the groundwork for novel models of 
decentralized coordination in 2026. 
Polygon 
What Went Right in 2025 
 
Polymarket was Polygon’s clearest success in 2025, evolving from a niche prediction market into one of the largest sources of onchain 
transactional demand. The shift became apparent during the 2024 U.S. election cycle, when notional trading volume scaled from hundreds of 
millions to more than $3 billion per month across October, November, and December. Cumulative trading volume rose from $192.4 million at the 
end of 2023 to $14.43 billion by the end of 2024. 
Critically, 2025 did not retrace to pre-election levels. Monthly volumes stabilized in a new range of roughly $1.10 to $2.65 billion from January 
               
 


---

## Page 166

165 
through September, before moving above $4 billion in October and November. By the end of November 2025, cumulative notional volume 
reached $36.46 billion, meaning Polymarket processed $22.03 billion in 2025, a 57% YTD increase with one month still remaining. 
Polymarket’s growth in 2025 underscored Polygon’s strengths as an execution layer for consumer-scale applications. Polygon’s low fees and 
predictable execution allowed sustained, high-frequency transaction ﬂow to scale into the billions of dollars per month without degrading user 
experience. At that scale, Polymarket served as clear proof that Polygon can reliably support high-volume, consumer-facing activity, strengthening 
Polygon’s payments thesis heading into 2026. The same attributes that enabled Polymarket’s growth, low fees, stable execution, and deep 
stablecoin liquidity, underpin Polygon’s emerging role as a settlement environment for everyday payment ﬂows. 
2026 Outlook 
 
Polygon enters 2026 with a more credible payments narrative than at any prior point. Stablecoin rails, merchant processors, and consumer-facing 
ﬁntech integrations all expanded meaningfully through 2025, and the payments-app transfer data shows Polygon PoS absorbing real settlement 
volume rather than sporadic transactional bursts. 
               
 


---

## Page 167

166 
The payments app's throughput is already at over $1 billion per month. Tracked payments apps on Polygon PoS processed $369 million in 
January, $736 million in September, and exceeded $1 billion in October and November, totaling $6.4 billion in YTD transfer volume. Growth was 
broad-based across processors, including Avenia, Paxos, Revolut, BlindPay, Cobo, Coinﬂow, and a long tail of regional ﬁntechs. 
Stablecoin user penetration is deep and expanding. Stablecoin P2P unique addresses on Polygon have grown to 20.9 million, up from 8.1 million 
in 2024, while cumulative USDC/USDT addresses on Polygon PoS exceed 98 million (55.3 million USDC + 42.7 million USDT). This provides a 
large addressable base for apps that automate spending, cross-border transfers, and ﬁat-adjacent payments. 
Merchant and ﬁntech rails are consolidating around Polygon. Paxos-powered ﬂows (supporting entities like PayPal and Mercado Pago), Circle 
integrations, CEX-issued stablecoin ramps, LATAM neobanks, and on/oﬀ-ramp processors all increased in 2025. On the merchant/card side, 
processors such as MoonPay, Coinbase Commerce, Bitso, Lemon Cash, Buenbit, Rain, and Bank Frick are facilitating a growing share of ﬂows. 
Much of this activity now comes from non-crypto-native users transacting through custodial wallets and ﬁntech interfaces. As these channels 
scale, a growing share of Polygon’s stablecoin movement is routed through consumer apps, cards, CEX ramps, and payment processors rather 
than direct wallet-to-wallet transfers. 
In 2026, the focus shifts from proving that onchain payments work on Polygon to scaling them into a durable, multi-billion-dollar monthly 
category. With Q4 2025 already sustaining more than $1 billion in monthly throughput, the next phase is scaling this activity as processors deepen 
integrations and as ﬂows shift from one-oﬀ transactions into recurring consumer spend. Under this progression, Polygon’s monthly payments 
volume could reasonably reach the $2.5-$3.0 billion range in 2026, driven not by single breakthrough events but by the steady maturation of card 
programs, merchant rails, CEX ramps, and regional ﬁntech corridors.

Tezos 
What Went Right in 2025 
Etherlink was Tezos’ clearest success in 2025, moving from a small-scale L2 with $1.5 million in TVL at the beginning of 2025 to the central hub 
for transactions, fee revenue, and DeFi by year-end. Year-to-date, Etherlink processed 49.6 million transactions versus 38.9 million on Tezos L1, 
accounting for 56% of total network activity. Over the same period, Etherlink generated 170,170 XTZ in fees compared to 48,100 XTZ on Tezos 
L1, generating 78% of protocol revenue. 
               
 


---

## Page 168

167 
 
DeFi TVL was one of the clearest indicators of users adopting Etherlink. DeFi TVL grew from $1.5 million at the start of 2025 to $67.7 million. 
Compared to Tezos L1’s TVL of $32.1 million, Etherlink’s TVL was 2.1x higher at year-end. Most of Etherlink’s TVL sat in a handful of core 
platforms. As of November 2025, Curve had $31.5 million in TVL, Superlend held $12.9 million, and the leading RWA protocols, Spiko and 
Uranium.io, together held $18.9 million. By year-end, most DeFi users on Tezos were participating on Etherlink rather than on the L1. 
User behavior in 2025 explains why Etherlink pulled ahead. Most new incentives (Apple Farm), DeFi deployments (Curve, Superlend), and RWA 
products (Spiko, Uranium.io) all launched on Etherlink, so liquidity and attention naturally followed. Additionally, EVM tooling made it easier for 
teams to migrate and for users to reuse existing wallets and workﬂows, while network upgrades reduced eﬀective fees and bridge times compared 
to interacting directly on the L1. Over the year, Etherlink averaged 4,610 daily active addresses, compared to 2,150 on the L1, as almost all new 
ﬁnancial activity chose the rollup. 
Additionally, the base layer evolved to support this setup. In 2025, Tezos reduced block times to 6 seconds, shortened cycles to roughly one day, 
and began paying bakers who ran DAL nodes. Shorter block times, faster cycles, and data availability backed by the Data Availability Layer 
(DAL) provide Etherlink with a faster and more secure settlement anchor for publishing and ﬁnalizing L2 activity. As a result, Tezos ended 2025

resembling an L2-ﬁrst stack, where Etherlink handles most of the execution and DeFi, and Tezos L1 focuses on security, governance, and data. 
2026 Outlook 
Tezos enters 2026 with Etherlink as the main activity hub and Tezos L1 as the settlement, governance, and DAL layer. The goal now is to scale 
Etherlink activity even further and surpass nine ﬁgures in TVL. 
In 2026, the priority will be to make Etherlink usage more stable and less dependent on event-driven campaigns, such as Apple Farm Season 1 and 
Season 2. On Etherlink, this means shifting from incentive-driven TVL to deeper liquidity in Curve, lending markets, and RWA assets, and 
potentially introducing new DeFi products like perps or vault strategies. On Tezos L1, the focus is shared infrastructure and governance that 
maintains Etherlink as the main liquidity and application hub. If those goals are met, Tezos would exit 2026 with Etherlink as a stable, mid-tier 
EVM environment and DeFi ecosystem with a base layer that supports Etherlink and any future Tezos X rollups. 
To stay up to date with Tezos, refer to Messari’s quarterly reports written by Jonny Kreiser. 
Stablechains 
Authors: Jake Koch-Gallup and Youssef Haidar 
Introduction 
Stablechains are purpose-built blockchains optimized for stablecoin use cases. They introduce features such as deterministic settlement, 
stablecoin-denominated fees, and complaint conﬁdentiality mechanisms. Rather than competing for existing crypto-native activity, their success 
depends on whether they can unlock new categories of users and payment ﬂows that are poorly served by general-purpose blockchains today. 
Viewed through this lens, we are selectively bullish. Stablechains that prioritize ﬁat integrations, regulatory compliance, and distribution are 
well-positioned to outperform their peers in the short to medium term. Arc and Tempo stand out within this cohort because they are built 
alongside the institutions and platforms most likely to adopt them. In contrast, many other stablechains are developing infrastructure in 
anticipation of demand, while Circle and Stripe already sit directly in the ﬂow of stablecoin issuance, payments, and settlement. 
We do not expect activity on general-purpose blockchains to drastically shift to stablechains in 2026. Solana, Base and similar networks will 
continue to capture speculative and DeFi activity, while TRON is likely to remain a major venue for inter-exchange and P2P USDT transfers, 
particularly in emerging markets, given its existing distribution and low-cost settlement. 
Arc and Tempo are eﬀectively competing with messaging networks like SWIFT, payment processors, and payment rails like ACH, not DeFi 
protocols. The degree of upside depends on these networks’ ability to bring these oﬀchain ﬂows onchain via purpose-built stablechains. 
Why Build a Stablechain? 
A natural objection is why Arc and Tempo need their own L1 instead of launching as Ethereum L2s or as applications on general-purpose

blockchains. The answer hinges on three recurring themes: control of the stack, alignment with ﬁat settlement norms, and strategic positioning. 
First, both Circle and Stripe view ﬁnancial infrastructure as a core component of their competitive advantage. If they deploy on another 
blockchain, the network architecture and roadmap may not prioritize payments or align with the ﬁrm's internal goals. More importantly, a 
meaningful share of economic value created by those payment ﬂows would accrue to an external base layer rather than to the issuer or platform 
originating the activity. By owning the L1, they can treat the chain as dedicated infrastructure, tailor it to their customers, and align value capture 
with the ﬂows they originate. 
Second, regulated ﬁnancial activity places very diﬀerent demands on settlement infrastructure than crypto-native applications. For banks, payment 
service providers (PSPs), and regulated ﬁntechs, settlement must be deterministic, costs must be predictable, and sensitive transaction data must 
be handled in a way that satisﬁes regulatory and contractual expectations. These properties are required to meet service-level agreements (SLAs), 
audit standards, and legal obligations. While L1s and L2s are slowly adopting features like gas abstraction and privacy, they still rely on 
probabilistic ﬁnality and force developers to depend on a patchwork of third-party middleware and compliance tooling. Stablechains can 
implement these features directly into the chain in ways that more closely mirror existing ﬁat settlement systems. 
Third, large enterprises require accountable counterparties rather than purely permissionless infrastructure. While a blockchain can provide 
transaction ﬁnality, it cannot oﬀer the dedicated support teams, compliance guarantees, and legal recourse that deﬁne enterprise relationships. 
Integrating Arc or Tempo bridges this gap by pairing onchain settlement with an SLA-backed operating model anchored to regulated partners such 
as Circle or Stripe. 
Taken together, these design and distribution choices point toward a more segmented blockchain landscape. General-purpose chains will continue 
to dominate speculative activity and crypto-native ecosystems. Stablechains, by contrast, will focus on settlement-heavy use cases where 
predictability, accountability, and integration with ﬁat systems are more important than open-ended composability. Arc and Tempo are currently 
the clearest expressions of this specialized design space. 
A Tale of Two Stablechains 
Although Arc and Tempo are both built around stablecoins, they target diﬀerent users and occupy distinct positions in the value chain.

Arc is Circle’s attempt to build an institutional operating system for tokenization, B2B payments, and institutional FX, with USDC at its monetary 
base. It targets highly regulated ﬁnancial institutions such as banks, broker-dealers, PSPs, and asset managers. For these users, Arc supports 
onchain issuance and settlement, conversion across ﬁat-backed stablecoins through StableFX, and cross-border payments within established 
regulatory and operational norms. 
Arc is also positioned favorably to banks and PSPs that directly compete with Stripe. A cross-border PSP, card network, or acquiring bank is 
unlikely to standardize settlement on a Stripe-aligned chain, but may be comfortable with Circle as a regulated and neutral issuer and 
infrastructure provider. That neutrality, combined with deterministic sub-second ﬁnality, opt-in conﬁdential transfers with view keys, and a 
permissioned validator set comprising known institutions, gives Arc a credible pitch as an institutional-grade L1. Arc has partnered with over 110 
issuers, payment ﬁrms, ﬁnancial institutions, analytics & RPC providers, exchanges, market makers, and developer tools. Arc is being shaped in 
direct collaboration with the institutions that are most likely to operate, govern, and settle meaningful volume on the network in production.

Tempo sits on the opposite end of the user spectrum. It is designed as a payments-ﬁrst chain that augments Stripe’s existing rails. Its natural users 
are Stripe-native merchants and platforms, ﬁntechs that do not directly compete with Stripe, online marketplaces, or payroll platforms that need 
predictable, low-cost payouts. From this perspective, Tempo plays the role of an onchain settlement layer rather than a general-purpose 
blockchain. 
Technically, Tempo’s architecture reinforces that positioning. The network eliminates the need for a native gas token by allowing fees to be paid 
directly in any supported USD-denominated stablecoin through an enshrined AMM, ensuring that merchants and PSPs can transact and settle in 
the same unit of account. At the token layer, the TIP-20 standard embeds compliance controls and payment metadata directly into the asset itself, 
allowing issuers to carry existing operational and regulatory workﬂows onchain. At the execution layer, dedicated payment lanes and a native 
stablecoin DEX help keep routine transfers predictable and eﬃciently routed, even during periods of elevated network activity. 
By abstracting away gas management, fee volatility, and payment congestion, Tempo removes many of the operational frictions that slow

enterprise adoption. As a result, its path to scale runs through embedded distribution rather than organic crypto-native usage. 
D.R.E.A.M (Distribution Rules Everything Around Me) 
Distribution is a key factor in determining success for a stablechain. Stripe already sits in the ﬂow of funds for millions of merchants and 
platforms. If “settle in stablecoins on Tempo” becomes an option in Stripe’s interface rather than a standalone integration, Tempo immediately 
gains access to a large user base that cares about settlement times and costs, not about crypto infrastructure. KlarnaUSD, launched as the ﬁrst 
bank-issued stablecoin on Tempo, is an early example of this pattern: a consumer ﬁntech that doesn’t compete directly with Stripe, using Tempo 
to improve cross-border payments for its existing customers. 
The segmentation between Arc and Tempo can be summarized: 
● Arc is best positioned for regulated institutional ﬂows. Its natural adopters are banks, asset managers, FX and capital markets 
infrastructures, and PSPs or card networks that compete with Stripe but are comfortable with Circle as a neutral issuer and infrastructure 
provider. For this group, deterministic ﬁnality, conﬁdential yet auditable transfers, and integration with yield-bearing collateral (USYC) and 
other tokenized assets are more important than transparency or composability. 
● Tempo is best positioned for Stripe-aligned users and startups. Its natural adopters are merchants, SaaS businesses, gig and marketplace 
platforms, and consumer ﬁntechs that already rely on Stripe or similar infrastructure. For them, the value lies in cheaper cross-border 
settlement, programmable payouts, and the ability to ignore gas tokens and FX routing entirely. 
Arc and Tempo are not direct competitors. While they both are stablechains, their distribution networks and user bases only partially overlap. The 
constraint for both is not throughput; it is convincing the right institutions and platforms to leverage their stablechain as a settlement rail in 
production rather than an R&D initiative. 
Not All Stablechains are Created Equal

## Page 174

Taken together, the diﬀerences in distribution and target users leave us cautiously optimistic about the stablechain sector. Stablechains that are 
tightly wired into real-world distribution via banks, PSPs, or large platforms, and native stablecoin integrations from the issuer have a plausible 
path to relevance. Arc and Tempo both clear that bar. Arc has a credible shot at becoming the default rail for institutional FX, tokenized assets, 
and B2B payments if Circle partners with leading ﬁnancial institutions and maintains regulatory goodwill. Tempo has a chance of becoming the 
optimal payment rail for payouts and merchant ﬂows if Stripe chooses to route even a modest share of its business through it and if regulators 
remain comfortable with consumer-facing stablecoin settlement. 
We are skeptical of stablechains that lack either issuer adjacency or real distribution, regardless of technical sophistication. Without corridors, 
direct mint and redeem access, and integration into existing ﬁat workﬂows, there is no clear path from technical eﬃciency to meaningful adoption 
as a settlement layer. Over the next year, this will make most stablechains look underwhelming relative to general-purpose blockchains on 
headline metrics, such as TVL and volume. 
The thesis for Arc and Tempo does not depend on near-term optics. It depends on whether, a few years from now, a meaningful share of the 
world’s FX, treasury, and payment ﬂows are settling on stablechains and not legacy systems. On that speciﬁc question, our view is that Arc and

Tempo are currently the two most credible contenders. 
Bitcoin Layers 
Author: AJC 
A Year of Disappointment 
One of the most disappointing sectors in 2025 has been Bitcoin layers, a broad category that includes L2s, sidechains, state chains, and other 
networks aligned with either Bitcoin (the network) or BTC (the asset). After the surge in activity around Ordinals (NFTs) and Runes (tokens) 
directly on Bitcoin in late 2023 and early 2024, momentum shifted toward protocols aimed at scaling Bitcoin or expanding its functionality. 
For the purposes of this report, networks that support a bridged version of BTC have been split into three diﬀerent categories: 
● Alt L1s & More (i.e., Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, etc.) - Networks that support bridged version(s) of BTC, but the underlying network is 
sovereign from the Bitcoin network. 
● Sidesystems (i.e., Stacks, Rootstock, Core, etc.) - Networks that support bridged versions(s) of BTC and provide oﬀchain execution for 
Bitcoin users. 
● Bitcoin Native (i.e., Lightning Network) - Networks that support bridged version(s) of BTC and allow users to unilaterally exit the oﬀchain 
system back to Bitcoin. 
Bridged BTC

## Page 176

175 
 
Initially, there appeared to be strong demand for Bitcoin layers. At the beginning of the year, 47,900 BTC were bridged to Sidesystems, and an 
additional 5,100 BTC were bridged to Bitcoin Native protocols, totaling 53,000 BTC bridged to Bitcoin layers. Over the course of 2025, however, 
bridged BTC has steadily ﬂowed out of Sidesystems, as bridged BTC is down 22% to 37,500 BTC. 
Bridged BTC to Bitcoin Native protocols have grown modestly, up 6% to 5,400 BTC, but not nearly enough to oﬀset losses from side systems. 
Perhaps a bigger indictment is not the decline in bridged BTC to Bitcoin layers, but the fact that BTC bridged to Alt L1s & More increased over 
the same period, rising 12% to 327,500 BTC. 
Taken together, users are currently better served by Alt L1s & More for their BTC programmability needs. Despite renewed interest in 
Bitcoin-aligned execution environments, over 88% of all bridged BTC remains on networks that are sovereign from Bitcoin.

A closer look at Bitcoin layers reveals a widening divergence in performance across protocols. Merlin still holds the leading position for bridged 
BTC among Bitcoin layers, with 14,900 BTC. However, its share has gradually eroded, down 36% year-to-date, as a result of its “Very High” trust 
assumptions and limited diﬀerentiation relative to other Bitcoin layers. Absent major changes, it's unlikely that Merlin will be able to maintain its 
bridged BTC advantage over time. 
A notable standout in 2025 was Stacks. Bridged BTC on Stacks increased 269% year-to-date to 4,600 BTC, making it the third-largest Bitcoin 
layer by the amount of bridged BTC. This growth was driven primarily by the rollout of sBTC in the ﬁrst half of 2025, Stacks’ native bridged 
version of BTC, as detailed in our State of Stacks H1 2025 report. Outside of Stacks, no other Bitcoin layer experienced meaningful growth in 
bridged BTC. Bitcoin layers are increasingly competing for a shrinking pool of capital rather than growing the category as a whole. 
DeFi TVL

Bridged BTC, while an important metric, is not the sole measure of success for a Bitcoin layer. DeFi TVL is equally important, as it captures not 
only BTC that is being used productively rather than passively held, but also other onchain assets that participate in DeFi activity. 
 
Viewed through this lens, several insights emerge. Notably, the largest Bitcoin layer by DeFi TVL is Starknet. Despite having only 2,200 BTC 
bridged, Starknet leads all Bitcoin layers with $224.2 million in DeFi TVL. Starknet’s DeFi TVL has beneﬁted signiﬁcantly from its “BTCFi” 
initiative, which launched in October and allocated 100 million STRK ($11.7 million) in incentives toward BTC-related DeFi activity on the 
network. The second-largest Bitcoin layer by DeFi TVL is Rootstock, one of the oldest Bitcoin layers, which oﬀers a relative maturity advantage 
over newer entrants. The only other Bitcoin layer with more than $100 million in DeFi TVL is Stacks, which similarly beneﬁts from its longer 
operating history. 
As a whole, however, 2025 was a diﬃcult year for DeFi TVL across Bitcoin layers. The total DeFi TVL has declined 67% year-to-date, falling 
from $2.25 billion to $753.2 million. While multiple factors contributed to this contraction, a primary driver has been the exhaustion of incentive

programs launched by various Bitcoin layers in 2023 and 2024. As these incentives waned, mercenary capital, largely motivated by yield rather 
than a desire to hold or earn passive returns on BTC, migrated toward more attractive opportunities outside of Bitcoin layers. 
2026 Outlook 
 
So far, Starknet’s BTCFi initiative appears to be gaining traction. At the beginning of 2025, just $9.3 million of BTC was bridged to Starknet. 
Following the launch of BTCFi, that ﬁgure increased by 2,055% to $201.1 million. Excluding STRK, BTC derivatives are now the largest bridged 
asset on Starknet, surpassing stablecoins ($155.5 million), ETH derivatives ($86.4 million), and RWAs ($2.8 million). That said, incentives are a 
meaningful driver of this activity, and it remains to be seen whether this demand persists once incentives taper. 
Ultimately, Starknet’s success hinges on its ability to bridge the gap between Ethereum’s mature DeFi ecosystem and BTC. If it can consistently 
route BTC liquidity into Ethereum-native applications while maintaining a user experience and risk proﬁle that BTC holders are willing to accept, 
Starknet could emerge as a critical execution environment. In doing so, it would occupy a unique position within the Bitcoin ecosystem, carving

out a defensible and highly valuable niche that few other Bitcoin layers are structurally capable of addressing. 
 
Outside of Starknet, another area to monitor for the Bitcoin ecosystem are the upcoming launches of Alpen and Citrea. Alpen is a proposed 
validity rollup on Bitcoin that uses a SNARK-based system to prove the correctness of batched state transitions, while Citrea follows a similar 
approach, combining a zkVM with recursive SNARKs to compress and prove oﬀchain execution. Alpen and Citrea will likely be the ﬁrst 
Bitcoin-native rollups to reach mainnet. What diﬀerentiates rollups from earlier Bitcoin layers is that they aim to make Bitcoin the canonical 
source of truth for system state, rather than merely an asset used within an oﬀchain execution environment. Although they still won’t be able to 
guarantee complete trustlessness, they represent the most direct attempts to bring trust-minimized, execution-layer scalability to Bitcoin while 
preserving its settlement guarantees.

Oracles 
In 2025, the oracle sector shifted towards institutional use cases and continued to be led by Chainlink in total value secured (TVS). 
 
Chainlink’s TVS market share increased from 52% ($34.1 billion) on January 1 to 62% ($48.6 billion) on November 30. That growth was driven 
primarily by the expansion of Aave V3. Aave accounts for 67% ($31.5 billion) of Chainlink’s TVS. Aave’s TVL increased 60% year-to-date from 
$19.7 billion to $31.5 billion, directly lifting Chainlink’s TVS. 
Chainlink’s TVS also beneﬁted from TRON discontinuing its use of the WINkLink oracle and migrating to Chainlink on May 15. That transition 
added $5.5 billion in TVS as Chainlink began securing JustLend, TRON’s largest DeFi application at the time. The shift reshaped the oracle

181 
landscape. WINkLink entered 2025 as the third-largest oracle by TVS with a 10% ($6.4 billion) market share on January 1, but its share has since 
fell to 0%. 
Outside of Chainlink and WINkLink, the competitive picture remained largely static. Chronicle held second place throughout the year, with TVS 
market share increasing modestly from 10% ($7.1 billion) on January 1 to 11% ($8.8 billion) on November 30. Pyth moved in the opposite 
direction, with TVS market share declining from 9% ($6.2 billion) to 6% ($4.5 billion) over the same time frame. 
In the second half of the year, oracle providers expanded beyond their main role of securing onchain protocols into delivering ﬁnancial data for 
institutional use cases. This shift reﬂected a broader push to compete with incumbent market data providers such as Bloomberg Terminal and S&P 
Global Market Intelligence by oﬀering low-latency crypto and traditional ﬁnancial data that can be consumed both onchain and oﬀchain. 
Pyth moved directly into this opportunity. On September 24, Pyth launched Pyth Pro, a permissioned data service for $10,000 per month that 
oﬀers 1ms update latency across more than 2,200 price feeds, including crypto assets, equities, futures, commodities, and interest rates. Adoption 
accelerated quickly as in Q3, Pyth Pro had 28 active subscribers, up from eight in Q2, pointing to early institutional demand and initial signs of 
PMF. 
Institutional demand matters because data budgets at traditional ﬁnancial ﬁrms materially exceed what DeFi usage alone can support. In 2025, a 
single Bloomberg Terminal cost roughly $25,000–$30,000 per year per user, and Bloomberg Terminal generated an estimated $10.6 billion in 
revenue in 2024. If oracle providers capture even a small portion of that revenue by replacing or complementing incumbent data services, 
institutional revenue will surpass what oracles generate today from securing DeFi protocols alone. 
Chainlink pursued a broader strategy in 2025 focused on institutional and DeFi data connectivity. Throughout the year, Chainlink partnered with 
multiple ﬁnancial institutions to bring regulated assets and market data onchain. This included its June 24 partnership with Mastercard, which 
enabled more than three billion cardholders to purchase crypto assets directly onchain through the Chainlink-powered Swapper app. Also on 
August 11, Chainlink partnered with ICE, the parent company of the NYSE, to bring forex and precious metals data onchain. Together, these 
partnerships expanded Chainlink’s role beyond a DeFi oracle into an institutional data oracle that can support regulated ﬁnancial products across 
blockchains. 
In 2026, we believe Chainlink will continue to dominate onchain TVS through its entrenchment across large DeFi protocols, while institutional 
data services and partnerships will emerge as the primary revenue growth driver for oracle providers. 
Cross-chain / Interoperability 
In 2025, the cross-chain landscape shifted toward trust-minimized security models, native asset interoperability, and institutional-grade 
infrastructure.

THORChain made up 67% of all cross-chain volume year-to-date. The protocol launched an enshrined oracle, eliminating dependencies on 
external oracles and reducing systemic risks for users. TRON and Solana are now supported networks, signiﬁcantly widening the protocol’s 
addressable market. THORChain’s dominance in 2025 was bolstered by a surge in volume following the $1.5 billion security breach of the Bybit 
exchange in February. During the week ending March 2, the protocol processed a record $4.66 billion in swaps, including over $1 billion in a 
single day, as perpetrators utilized THORChain’s permissionless infrastructure to move assets. Despite the ﬂows illicit nature, the event served as 
a high-stakes “stress test,” demonstrating the protocol’s ability to facilitate multi-billion, non-custodial swaps with zero downtime. 
A rising star in 2025 was NEAR Intents. NEAR Intents processed $6.8 billion in cross-chain volume, surging 57,055% year-to-date. In total, 
NEAR Intents made up 15% of YTD cross-chain volume. The surge in demand was driven by a desire for permissionless interoperability 
infrastructure and one-click swaps that abstract away the complexities of cross-chain transactions. Users sign the transactions they want, and a 
solver network competes to source liquidity across chains and execute the route, so the wallet can deliver a single swap experience instead of a 
multi-step cross-chain ﬂow. 
THORChain and NEAR Intents have captured 83% of all cross-chain volume year-to-date, signaling strong user preferences toward

trust-minimized chain abstraction. 
LayerZero increased its cross-chain volume by 809% year-to-date. The team acquired Stargate for $110 million in August 2025. The acquisition 
transforms ZRO into a productive asset by redirecting 50% of Stargate’s revenues toward buybacks, a ﬁgure set to rise to 100% in March 2026. 
This tethers the token’s performance directly to real-world usage, ensuring that every dollar of bridge volume generates persistent, non-speculative 
demand for ZRO. 
LayerZero’s omnichain fungible token (OFT) standard has been well-received by exchanges and asset issuers. In December 2025, Kraken 
partnered with LayerZero to power its wrapped bitcoin product, kBTC. Beyond crypto-native assets, LayerZero is making inroads within the Real 
World Asset (RWA) sector. PayPal adopted the standard to unify PYUSD liquidity across Ethereum and Solana, ensuring a seamless user 
experience for global payments. Similarly, IQ and Frax utilized the tech to launch KRWQ, the ﬁrst multi-chain Korean Won stablecoin, while 
Dinari integrated it to enable compliant, cross-chain transfers for tokenized securities. 
In March 2025, Circle released Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) V2. This upgrade shifted USDC from a collection of isolated network 
tokens into a truly uniﬁed global balance, no longer relying on fragmented liquidity pools and vulnerable wrapped assets. 
With the introduction of "Hooks," cross-chain composability evolved from a multi-step friction point into an invisible infrastructure layer, 
enabling users to sign transactions that bridge funds and immediately deploy them on another chain. This removes the need to wait or switch 
networks, making the entire cross-chain process feel like a single, instant interaction.Wormhole transitioned away from a wrapped token model to 
support native tokens using the Native Token Transfer (NTT) standard. NTT was the backbone for the launch of Monad’s native bridge. Sunrise, a 
gateway that uniﬁes liquidity between Solana and Monad, demonstrated the power of NTT, enabling instant, native liquidity at launch without the 
fragmentation typically seen in bootstrapping new ecosystems. 
Chainlink continued to fortify its institutional moat. In December 2025, Chainlink’s CCIP was selected by Coinbase as the exclusive bridge 
infrastructure for over $7 billion in wrapped assets, such as cbBTC and cbETH. This partnership further reinforces Chainlink as an industry 
standard for institutional cross-chain infrastructure. 
In 2026, we anticipate that the sector will increasingly focus on privacy-preserving interoperability. THORChain’s upcoming Monero integration 
will enable users to swap between transparent assets, such as BTC, and XMR, without the need for centralized intermediaries. Simultaneously, 
Chainlink’s Conﬁdential Compute will enable institutions to verify sensitive and proprietary data within secure enclaves (TEEs) while settling 
results onchain, bridging the gap between the need for privacy and auditability when it launches next year. 
Privacy 
Privacy has long been one of crypto’s most compelling narratives. It is recognized as important in principle, yet historically underprioritized in 
practice. For years, privacy was treated as a niche capability at best and a regulatory risk at worst, often associated with money laundering or 
attempts to evade oversight. 
               
 


---

## Page 185

184 
That perception is beginning to shift. While uncertainty remains, the regulatory environment around privacy tools has become more friendly. In 
March 2025, OFAC removed Tornado Cash from its sanctions list, even as co-founder Roman Storm was later convicted of operating an 
unlicensed money transmitting business, and jurors deadlocked on the money laundering and sanctions charges. In December 2025, President 
Trump also expressed willingness to consider a pardon for Keonne Rodriguez, the CEO of the privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet Samourai. 
Onchain activity is also beginning to reﬂect this shift in sentiment. Market interest has returned to privacy networks, and established projects like 
Zcash have experienced a sharp surge in shielded value since late 2024. The price of ZEC climbed over 672% YoY from $60 to $459, and 
shielded ZEC now accounts for 65%of total TVL across the privacy sector. 
 
This resurgence indicates that the need for privacy is no longer theoretical. As more value moves onchain, full transparency shifts from an 
advantage to a liability. Broadcasting positions, counterparties, execution prices, or treasury movements in real time is not viable for large market 
participants. Traditional ﬁnance has long relied on dark pools and OTC desks to protect sensitive trading information. As traditional assets are 
increasingly tokenized and institutional investors continue to experiment with onchain ﬁnance, privacy is becoming a requirement rather than an

185 
optional feature. 
Earlier eﬀorts to bring privacy onchain struggled because they imposed high costs on users and developers. Users were often required to leave 
familiar ecosystems, pay additional bridging costs, or accept a degraded user experience. Developers faced the need to learn new languages or 
build within isolated stacks that lacked interoperability with the broader DeFi landscape. Privacy on its own was rarely a compelling product. 
Privacy paired with a seamless onchain experience is. 
In 2025, the design approach is shifting. Privacy is increasingly being built as embedded infrastructure rather than as a separate destination. 
Instead of forcing migration, projects are integrating privacy into environments where users already operate. The Ethereum Foundation has 
launched initiatives focused on wallet-level and application-level opt-in privacy, aiming to make privacy feel native rather than an add-on. Its 
Kohaku initiative integrates protocols like Railgun into an open source SDK to target default privacy across Ethereum-connected wallets such as 
MetaMask. At the same time, protocols such as Oasis and Phala are positioning privacy as a modular tool that can be integrated directly into 
existing applications. 
Technical progress is also accelerating. Zama has launched the fhEVM coprocessor, allowing developers to write conﬁdential smart contracts in 
Solidity while operating on encrypted data. Privacy Pools introduce the concept of association sets, enabling users to prove that funds are not 
linked to illicit activity without revealing full transaction histories. Outside of crypto, Google Wallet has adopted zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) 
for age veriﬁcation, allowing users to prove eligibility without disclosing personal data. 
Privacy in 2025 is not about absolute anonymity. It must be context-aware, programmable, and capable of supporting regulatory requirements. The 
protocols most likely to succeed will not pursue complete opacity, but will enable selective disclosure that is both practical and secure. Achieving 
this will require continued progress in protocol design, policy alignment, and user experience, so that privacy becomes an expected standard of 
digital systems rather than a radical exception.

● Yield-bearing stablecoins will displace passive stables as core DeFi collateral, closing the gap between reserve yield and user returns. 
● DeﬁBanks will emerge as crypto’s answer to neobanks, bundling save, spend, and borrow features into self-custodial, high-margin apps. 
Introduction 
DeFi is no longer niche. The space has scaled with real users, meaningful revenue, and sharper protocol teams focused on sustainable value 
capture. DeFi no longer feels like a chaotic frontier; it feels like a professionalized battleﬁeld. 
Part of the reason this cycle felt so diﬀerent is that the controlling players have changed. TradFi recreated DeFi’s surface features, packaged them 
as compliant instruments, and sold them to retail under their own brand. These shifts are not failures of DeFi, but signals of its maturity. 
Institutions like Robinhood, Stripe, and BlackRock are not embracing DeFi out of ideology. They are reacting to its superior margins, faster 
iteration, and threat to their legacy business models. Like any good trade, once validated, it becomes crowded, and asymmetric upside is harder to 
ﬁnd. 
We predict that the next era of DeFi will not be purely deﬁned by yield or speculation, as was the case in previous cycles. It will be deﬁned by its 
ability to withstand geopolitical whiplash, growing economic insecurity, and bad‑faith actors exploiting crypto for personal gain.

Spot Volumes Hit ATHs in 2025

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) continued to gain ground against centralized exchanges (CEXs) in 2025. Year-to-date, DEX volumes reached 
$4.53 trillion, equivalent to 16% of CEX volumes ($29.04 trillion). This marks the third straight year in which DEX volume growth has outpaced 
CEX volume growth. DEX volumes were 10% of CEX volumes in 2024 and 8% in 2023. As blockchains continue to scale and infrastructure 
improves, more volume moving onchain remains the most sureﬁre trend for spot DEXs. 
Year-over-year, daily average spot DEX volumes are up an impressive amount as well. In 2024, the daily average volume was $7.04 billion, while 
in 2025 it has climbed to $13.51 billion, a 92% increase. Memecoin mania crescendoed in January with the launch of TRUMP, which brieﬂy set 
an all-time monthly volume record at $556.52 billion. That high was later eclipsed in October ($563.74 billion) after the market reached a local 
peak and experienced the largest deleveraging event on record on October 10, 2025.

Ethereum no longer represents the majority of onchain volume the way it did in past cycles. Over the past two years, both Solana and BNB Chain 
have emerged as premier venues for spot trading, accounting for 26% and 20% of onchain volume over the last three months. Ethereum and its 
L2s are not far behind, at 19% and 17%, respectively. Even so, as volumes become more distributed across blockchains, competition for them has 
never been ﬁercer.

Uniswap remains the top DEX by volume, yet its overall market share has gradually declined. In 2024, Uniswap accounted for 28% of all DEX 
volumes; in 2025, that share dropped to 21%. Notably, this trend isn’t just the result of volumes shifting away from Ethereum. Uniswap is also 
facing increased competition on Ethereum itself. In Q4’24, Uniswap V2 and V3 combined for 66% of Ethereum DEX volume, but so far in 
Q4’25, Uniswap V2, V3, and V4 together account for only 50%. The biggest driver has been the emergence of Fluid as a leading venue for 
stablecoin swaps. In Q4’25, Fluid captured 21% of Ethereum DEX volume, up dramatically from just 3% in Q4’24. 
Volumes on Solana have also undergone a dramatic shift in 2025. In Q4'24, Raydium accounted for nearly half of Solana’s volumes, at 47%. In 
Q4’25, however, Raydium’s share fell to 15%. Raydium’s share of volume has declined as a result of other DEXs growing signiﬁcantly on Solana, 
such as prop AMMs. The leading prop AMM, HumidiFi, now ranks third across all DEXs by volume over the past three months and has become 
the top DEX on Solana. 
Outside of the top individual DEXs, there’s also a signiﬁcant long tail of protocols capturing a meaningful share. Over the past three months, 
DEXs outside the top six have averaged $6.82 billion in daily volume, or roughly 43% of all DEX activity during that period. Despite DEX 
volumes consistently growing year over year, no single protocol has emerged as the clear, dominant winner. Instead, the market continues to

exhibit a pattern of rotation, where each year a new DEX seemingly emerges, gains traction, and establishes a signiﬁcant market share, only to 
lose market share thereafter. The result is an ecosystem where growth is broad-based, competition is ﬂuid, and incumbency provides far less 
advantage than in previous cycles. 
 
Interestingly, despite DEX volumes reaching all-time highs, total DEX TVL has actually decreased in 2025. On January 1, DEX TVL sat at 
$22.36 billion; it has since fallen by 21% to $17.62 billion. Part of the reason for this has been greater capital eﬃciency. In 2024, spot DEXs 
averaged a daily turnover rate of 36% (daily volume divided by DEX TVL). In 2025, average daily turnover has nearly doubled, reaching 63% so 
far, meaning each dollar of liquidity is supporting almost twice as much trading activity as last year. 
There are two main reasons behind this surge in daily turnover. First, as blockchains scale and transaction costs continue to fall, the range of 
economically viable trading opportunities expands dramatically. When transactions cost $1,000, many arbitrage paths or microstructure 
ineﬃciencies simply cannot be captured. However, when the same transaction costs a penny, countless small opportunities become actionable, 
resulting in more trades, arbitrage, and volume throughout the ecosystem.

The second reason has been the shift away from traditional AMMs to prop AMMs and CLOBs. Prop AMMs are programmable liquidity pools 
that utilize oﬀchain price oracles for real-time price discovery to oﬀer tighter spreads and better prices for traders. Furthermore, since Prop AMMs 
don’t oﬀer passive liquidity, it also means they don’t have any TVL. Prop AMMs have had the most traction on Solana, whose high throughput, 
low latency, and cheap transaction costs have enabled them to ﬂourish. As mentioned earlier, HumidiFi, the largest Prop AMM on Solana, has 
quickly risen to third-largest DEX by volume in all of crypto. 
 
The other DEX architecture that has gained meaningful traction in 2025 is the Central Limit Order Book (CLOB). CLOBs are the default trading 
structure for CEXs and are, by design, the most eﬃcient matching model for price discovery. However, they require active market making, 
something that historically has been extremely diﬃcult to support onchain. High transaction costs and slow block times made it nearly impossible 
to run a performant, low-latency orderbook on most blockchains. 
Take Ethereum, for example. With a 12-second block time, providing liquidity on a CLOB is inherently risky. A market maker’s quote can easily

become stale before it is included in a block, increasing the risk of toxic ﬂow. And if the price moves against you, you are essentially forced into a 
bidding war with MEV bots to cancel your order in time, driving up gas costs and reducing the economic viability of quoting at all. These 
constraints meant that, for most of crypto’s history, onchain CLOBs simply couldn’t compete with AMM designs. 
 
This dynamic began to shift with Hyperliquid’s introduction of “cancel prioritization,” a mechanism that lowers execution risk for market makers 
by ensuring their cancel orders are processed ﬁrst. This innovation made quoting on an onchain CLOB far more practical and helped revive 
volume in orderbook-based DEX architectures in 2025. 
Combined, Prop AMMs and CLOBs facilitated $57.18 billion in volume in November, accounting for 14% of activity over that period. While still 
a minority share, this slice has been steadily growing as traders look for tighter spreads and better execution than traditional AMMs can oﬀer. If 
spot DEXs are going to keep gaining ground on CEXs, Prop AMMs and CLOBs will need to take on a larger share of onchain volume, especially 
for major assets like BTC, ETH, SOL, and stablecoins. These are the pairs where execution quality matters most, and where an improved market 
structure can have the greatest impact on overall DEX competitiveness compared to CEXs. 
Fortunately, Prop AMMs on Solana and Hyperliquid’s spot orderbook have already shown that it’s possible to build onchain markets that can 
compete with CEXs. As a result, these market types are likely to expand beyond the ecosystems where they ﬁrst encountered PMF. Ethereum L2s 
are a natural next step for Prop AMMs, and ultra-fast, low-latency chains like MegaETH should, in theory, be capable of supporting a fully 
onchain CLOB. Just as we saw with the AMMs of earlier cycles, there’s no guarantee that the leaders in Prop AMMs or spot CLOBs today will be 
the leaders of tomorrow. 
Building Moats

Spot DEXs are, without a doubt, one of the most competitive markets in crypto. With new entrants appearing every year and no single protocol 
consistently able to grow its market share, it’s worth taking a closer look at where value actually accrues in this sector. The volumes are large, and 
the activity is real, but the question of who captures the upside is far less straightforward. Examining the broader ecosystem around spot DEXs, 
wallets, trading bots, launchpads, aggregators, and the DEX protocols themselves helps clarify where economic moats can actually be built. 
The most commoditized segment of the stack is DEX aggregators. While DEX aggregators like Jupiter, 1inch, and CoWSwap provide a very 
useful service, it is a service that is tough to monetize. For example, Jupiter facilitated $47.40 billion in volume in November but generated only 
$660,000 in revenue from spot-related activity (with over 90% of its revenue instead coming from its perps protocol). That translates to an 
abysmally small margin of just 0.0014%. Despite commanding substantial volume, the economics of aggregation naturally push revenues toward 
zero as aggregators compete on routing quality and fees. 
Better, but still not great, businesses in the DEX stack are the DEXs themselves. Meteora, Raydium, PancakeSwap, and Fluid, all behemoths in 
terms of onchain volume, operated at margins of just 0.01% to 0.02% in November. A slight outlier was Aerodrome, which posted a margin of 
               
 


---

## Page 195

194 
0.07%. Importantly, though, Aerodrome runs a ve(3,3) model and distributes far higher incentives ($132.16 million in annualized token emissions) 
than traditional AMMs. In that context, the higher margin may simply be necessary to oﬀset the higher incentive burden. 
Nevertheless, DEXs only become viable businesses at an extreme scale. With margins hovering in the single-digit basis-point range, the only way 
to generate real revenue is to push massive volumes, and even then, competitive pressure makes it hard to build durable moats purely from spot 
trading fees. 
Ultimately, we believe there are three primary moats that can be built around spot DEXs. The ﬁrst are wallets. Since wallets are closest to the user, 
they can eﬀectively monetize by oﬀering convenience. Some users prefer not to open a browser within their wallet, type in a DEX or aggregator 
URL, connect their wallet, and navigate through multiple interfaces. They’d much rather tap twice and buy or sell whatever asset they want. It’s a 
simple business, but compared to the rest of the DEX stack, it has a surprisingly high margin. 
In November, Phantom generated $9.46 million in revenue on $993.2 million in swap volume, a margin of 0.95%. And despite not even clearing 
$1 billion in monthly volume, Phantom earned more revenue than every single DEX except Aerodrome. That is, in essence, the power of 
distribution and convenience. Even modest volumes can translate into meaningful revenue when you sit directly on the user’s path. 
The second moat, trading bots, sits at the opposite end of the spectrum. While wallets eﬀectively monetize unsophisticated retail through 
convenience, trading bots monetize sophisticated retail through execution. The saying “time is money” has never been more literal than in crypto, 
especially for users trading highly volatile assets like memecoins. A diﬀerence measured in milliseconds, not seconds, can determine whether a 
trade nets hundreds of thousands in proﬁt or ends in a total loss. Bots that can consistently guarantee top-tier execution can justify charging much 
higher margins for that service. Axiom is a prime example. In November, it generated $18.74 million in revenue on $1.63 billion in volume, a 
margin of 1.15%, the highest among this entire cohort. 
The last moat is asset issuance, which is currently best exempliﬁed through memecoin launchpads. While a user may not necessarily care whether 
their cbBTC purchase is routed through a DEX on Ethereum or a DEX on Solana, assuming they get the same execution, that same user will 
absolutely care where a memecoin is launched. As a mental exercise, imagine launching today’s viral memecoin on pump.fun on Solana, as well 
as on Fanko.tech on Sanko (yes, that’s a thing). Which one do you think ends up with the higher market cap? 
Launchpads have proven to be high-margin businesses because they oﬀer users distinct, unique assets that can’t be easily replicated elsewhere. For 
this reason, they can charge surprisingly high margins. Pump.fun generated the most revenue in this group, reaching $34.92 million in November, 
with a margin of 0.51%. Four.meme, a launchpad on BNB Chain, maintains an even higher margin of 1.05%, partly because it has been endorsed 
by Binance. 
While this logic is currently best exempliﬁed by memecoins, we believe it will expand to all net-new assets. A few DEXs are already moving in 
this direction. Uniswap recently unveiled its Continuous Clearing Auction (CCA) protocol, and Aerodrome launched Ignition, both of which 
allow projects to launch their tokens directly through the respective DEX. 
Looking ahead to 2026, capturing durable value in spot DEXs increasingly requires verticalization. Participants across the stack will bundle

## Page 196

195 
execution, distribution, and issuance into increasingly uniﬁed products. While these eﬀorts will originate from diﬀerent starting points, user-facing 
platforms like wallets versus execution-centric protocols like DEXs and aggregators, the end goal is to control more of the trading lifecycle to 
capture value beyond spot fees. 
Separately, this shift toward vertical integration opens the door to new monetization models. As reliance on basis-point fees becomes less viable, 
leading platforms may experiment with subscriptions or premium execution tiers. In 2026, the ability to move beyond transaction-based revenue 
may prove to be a key diﬀerentiator between protocols that merely facilitate activity and those that capture lasting value. 
Isolated Lending vs. Modular Lending 
 
Lending and borrowing in DeFi have long been dominated by monolithic protocols, such as Aave. However, over the past year, modular designs 
like Morpho and Euler have gained traction, posing the ﬁrst credible challenge to Aave’s dominance on Ethereum. 
               
 


---

## Page 197

196 
Strictly speaking, monolithic lending protocols use shared liquidity pools where all deposits fund all loans across supported assets. For example, 
USDC deposits can back loans collateralized by ETH, WBTC, or others. This design enables deep liquidity and low-maintenance capital 
deployment, but it also introduces protocol-wide risk. If one collateral asset fails, it can impact the solvency of the entire system, which is why 
monolithic protocols are conservative in what assets are supported to be supplied, used as collateral, or borrowed, as well as the parameters, 
including max loan-to-value, max borrow, etc. 
Modular lending protocols take a diﬀerent approach by separating risk across isolated lending markets. Each market or vault operates 
independently, with custom parameters often managed by third-party curators. If a vault with risky collateral generates bad debt, it does not 
impact other vaults, such as those based on ETH and USDC. This structure enables ﬂexible experimentation with a wide range of risk proﬁles 
while maintaining the integrity of the broader system. 
 
The long tail of assets continues to grow, and with it, demand to borrow against them. Modular lending protocols are best positioned to serve this 
market. While modular lending grew 40% year to date, its share still trails far behind monolithic protocols, which remain dominant despite a 5%

decline. 
 
The top Aave markets are ETH/BTC wrappers and stablecoins. This is partially due to the power law of onchain lending. The majority of 
collateral consists of BTC, ETH, and USDC/T. Additionally, Aave has only 120,800 monthly active users, whereas Morpho has 311,700 users. 
This suggests that the average wallet on Aave has more collateral and may beneﬁt from deeper liquidity for major assets. 
That said, modular lending is poised for growth. The rise of RWA-backed loans, competitive stablecoin yields, and distribution through strategic 
partnerships will likely drive more activity toward customizable, isolated lending markets.

Aave currently leads in RWA deposits, with $360 million, compared to Morpho, which has $240 million. We predict demand for RWA borrowing 
will increase in 2026 and believe Morpho’s model has structural advantages for lenders and RWA issuers. 
Aave operates via diﬀerent markets, or instances of its protocol that are entirely separate from one another. Aave’s V3 Horizon deployment is 
permissionless at the protocol level, but access to the underlying RWA tokens is permissioned. Markets are siloed from its main protocol, due to 
compliance requirements and to create diﬀerent risk proﬁles. Lenders in Horizon cannot tap into the broader liquidity of V3 Core but still assume 
shared risk across all RWAs within Horizon. In contrast, deployments like Aave V3 Prime and V3 Core exist to isolate risk proﬁles without 
restricting access through permissioning. 
Morpho takes a diﬀerent approach. The base protocol remains permissionless, while compliance is handled at the vault and market level. Issuers 
control access to their RWA vaults, enabling them to meet regulatory requirements while protecting lenders from cross-asset contagion. This 
structure enables greater ﬂexibility for institutions and more granular risk segmentation, albeit at the tradeoﬀ of albeit at the tradeoﬀ of fragmented 
liquidity and a higher burden on issuers to manage risk, compliance, and user access on a vault-by-vault basis.

Over the last year, Morpho vaults have yielded better returns on USDC compared to monolithic lending protocols. On Aave or Compound, risk 
parameters are conservative to protect the entire pool of assets. Because Morpho’s markets have isolated risk, vault curators can set more 
aggressive loan-to-value ratios and get higher leverage. Users of modular lending protocols enjoy greater ﬂexibility due to the variety of vault 
curators and a structural advantage that allows them to seek higher yields (with higher risk) if desired.

Finally, modular lending platforms can serve as backend liquidity layers for CEXs and neobanks. They oﬀer capital-eﬃcient infrastructure for 
funds, custodians, and institutions, facilitating distribution and making it easier to oﬀer lending and borrowing without building proprietary rails. 
The partnership between Morpho and Coinbase has already driven nearly $1 billion in new deposits to Morpho. Coinbase reportedly custodies 
more than 2.3 million BTC (over 10% of the total supply), and of that supply, 1.1 million BTC are customer-facing (indvidiuals and Coinbase 
Prime), pointing to a $100 billion addressable market for BTC-backed lending. 
Morpho has also secured integrations with platforms like Lemon, and promotes its SDK as a plug-and-play solution for institutions seeking to 
access onchain credit markets. Given these distribution channels and institutional tailwinds, we expect modular lending protocols like Morpho to 
outpace monolithic models such as Aave. 
The Future is Equity Perps 
Perpetual futures have cemented themselves as one of crypto’s most mainstream products. They oﬀer global, 24/7 access to synthetic leverage on

any asset, with no need for custody, settlement, or centralized clearing. Onchain perps now routinely settle hundreds of billions in monthly 
volume, driven by crypto-native traders seeking directional exposure, yield, or hedging instruments. Unlike other DeFi use cases that rely on 
slower retail adoption, perps found immediate product-market ﬁt among speculators and power users. 
 
Hyperliquid has emerged as the category leader. Since launching HyperCore in 2023, the protocol has processed over $2.8 trillion in volume 
year-to-date, capturing nearly 40% of the perp DEX market. This dominance is largely due to its performant CLOB engine, expansive asset 
listings, and smart use of airdrops and point incentives to bootstrap liquidity. Today, Hyperliquid ranks among the most proﬁtable DeFi apps on 
any chain, with transaction fees and taker spreads generating sustained revenue across cycles. Its growth has helped normalize perps as a core part 
of the crypto stack, alongside DEXs, lending, and staking. Looking ahead to 2026, we anticipate that equity perps will emerge as a major new 
theme, and Hyperliquid will may attract the majority of the ﬂow. However, don’t rule out Lighter, Aster, and edgeX, as they’ve carved out a 
sizeable market share for themselves at the end of 2025.

According to Cboe, 0DTEs (options contracts that expire the same day) have grown from 24% of total SPX option volume in 2021 to 60% as of 
May 2025. This reﬂects a shift in retail behavior toward high-leverage, short-duration trades, as opposed to passive exposure. Traders, especially 
younger and highly online demographics, appear to be gravitating toward faster, more reﬂexive market exposure, where outcomes depend heavily 
on timing and the behavior of other participants. In the crypto world, we often refer to this as PvP trading. 
               
 


---

## Page 204

203 
Perps improve on the 0DTE model by oﬀering a simpler, global, always-on instrument for short-term directional bets. They trade continuously, 
avoid the complexity of multi-dimensional option pricing, and can represent any equity or index. As perps have become more popular, we’ve seen 
more instances of equity-backed perps onchain through protocols like Ostium, Trade[XYZ], and Vest Markets. While they lack options’ 
convexity, equity perps could be more intuitive for retail users and unlock global access to U.S. equity exposure. 
 
The thesis for onchain equities has existed for years, but early implementations fell short. Platforms like Ostium validated demand but struggled to 
scale; at its peak, equities represented just 13% of Ostium’s open interest. This, in part, may have been due to a lack of liquidity, weak underlying 
infrastructure, and inferior distribution. 
In October 2025, Hyperliquid launched HIP-3, which enabled teams to permissionlessly launch perps markets on their order book (HyperCore). 
This meant equity perps could access the same liquidity, matching engine, and frontend as the rest of Hyperliquid perps.

## Page 205

Trade[XYZ], developed by the team behind Unit, was the ﬁrst to launch equity perps on Hyperliquid. In its ﬁrst full month, the protocol processed 
$7.7 billion in volume and now ranks as the eighth-largest perpetual DEX by open interest. 
A few factors make equity perps a timely and unique opportunity. Hyperliquid has created one of the most liquid onchain environments for perps, 
driven by a robust CLOB and an airdrop that catalyzed retail engagement. Unlike AMM-based models like GMX, which struggled to scale 
liquidity, Hyperliquid oﬀers market makers tight spreads and consistent volume, making it the ﬁrst DEX where equity perps can viably scale. 
Importantly, equity perps on Hyperliquid are oﬀered to the same users already trading crypto. As Trade[XYZ] expands its product suite across 
equities, indices, and tokens, it positions itself as a full-spectrum trading platform with a robust selection of tickers. 
There’s also a regulatory wedge. Equity perps remain oﬀ-limits to U.S. retail due to their similarity to Contracts for Diﬀerence (CFDs), which 
bypass clearinghouses and violate CFTC rules. That opens a clear path for Hyperliquid and Trade[XYZ] to serve international users while 
regulators work to deﬁne the perimeter for compliant perp markets. 
Equity perps are closer than ever to ﬁnding product-market ﬁt, and Hyperliquid and Trade[XYZ] are currently best positioned to capture that 
momentum. Still, two structural risks could threaten the long-term thesis.

First, Hyperliquid’s lead is narrowing. As of November 30, its share of perp DEX open interest has fallen to 55%, down from a peak above 90%. 
New competitors, such as Aster (20%) and Lighter (15%), are gaining ground, likely due to their point-based incentive programs. While demand 
may prove temporary, the shift signals that traders do not have loyalty to any one platform. 
Second, insider trading poses a unique risk to equity perps. Events like earnings and M&A carry high signal-to-noise ratios, and DEXs oﬀer a 
near-perfect venue for informed ﬂow: no KYC, high leverage, and low surveillance. Without suﬃcient retail activity to absorb losses, market 
makers could widen spreads or pull liquidity to avoid being exploited. This risk becomes more concerning as equity perps scale and attract 
institutional attention. 
Despite these risks, it seems we are in a "goldilocks" zone. The tech is ready, liquidity is present, and regulation is lagging behind. This creates a 
window for platforms like Trade[XYZ] to establish themselves as the leading venue for equity perps before the regulatory perimeter catches up. 
Increased demand for Exogenous Yield 
               
 


---

## Page 207

206 
Our view is that yield-bearing dollars backed by exogenous cash ﬂows (excluding treasury-bill revenue) will become a core collateral and savings 
asset in 2026. Exogenous yield in DeFi refers to returns whose source is identiﬁable oﬀchain cash ﬂows, such as institutional private credit, 
infrastructure revenue, or tokenized real estate income. As of December 11, 2025, tokenized U.S. Treasuries have reached a capitalization of $8.9 
billion, and current U.S. Treasuries yield 3.7%. At the same time, USDC and USDT holders still receive zero native yield, while Circle reports 
quarterly reserve income of roughly $711 million and Tether reports multi-billion-dollar annual proﬁts, largely from interest on Treasury 
portfolios that back their stablecoins. The result is a persistent spread between what stablecoin reserves earn and what stablecoin users receive, 
which creates a clear opening for exogenous yield wrappers that transmit these cash ﬂows to token holders. 
 
USD.Ai and Maple Finance are two successful examples of yield-bearing dollars that generate exogenous cash ﬂows through liquid, ERC-4626 
vault shares. USD.Ai issues a U.S. Treasury-backed stablecoin, USDai, that can be staked into sUSDai, an ERC-4626 vault share that earns yield 
from GPU-collateralized AI infrastructure loans while keeping idle capital in Treasury bills as a base return. Maple’s syrupUSDC/T product is 
also a yield-bearing ERC-4626 vault share that represents deposits into segregated institutional credit pools, which originate overcollateralized

207 
loans to trading ﬁrms and market makers against liquid digital-asset collateral, with legal segregation of pool assets and receivables. 
Both protocols have already attracted meaningful capital. USD.AI has $669.5 million in TVL, including $286.8 million in sUSDai, yielding a 
30-day APY of 9.7%. Maple manages $4.5 billion, including $2.4 billion in syrupUSDC/T earning an average 30-day APY of 5.5%. 
 
Exogenous, variable yields create a second layer of demand beyond simply holding these assets. Holders of sUSDai, syrupUSDC, and similar 
products need tools to either lock in current yields or speculate on how those yields will change as credit conditions, borrower demand, or AI 
hardware utilization shift. In traditional markets, this role is ﬁlled by interest rate swaps and bond futures. 
Onchain, this function is fulﬁlled by Pendle, which turns yield-bearing assets into explicit, tradeable interest rate instruments. Pendle wraps assets 
such as syrupUSDC and, prospectively, sUSDai into a standardized SY token, then splits that SY into a Principal Token (PT) and a Yield Token 
(YT) in a one-to-one ratio. Buyers of Principal Tokens lock in a ﬁxed rate on exogenous yield streams, and buyers of Yield Tokens obtain 
leveraged exposure to the ﬂoating component of those yields and can trade views on future borrowing demand and credit spreads in those sectors.

## Page 209

208 
Pendle’s V2 protocol has already seen signiﬁcant growth, with TVL at $3.7 billion, as the rise of yield-bearing assets, such as Ethena, emerged 
this year. As more exogenous revenue products come to market in 2026, the set of markets that Pendle can list expands. Each new market brings 
additional demand for allocators and traders to speculate on the forward yield for that speciﬁc asset. 
DayFi, a product by Daylight, is expected to launch in early 2026 and is a non-pegged yield coin backed by real-world energy assets. It is an 
income-generating asset that provides exposure to decentralized energy infrastructure while integrating directly with DeFi markets. 
Unlike soft-pegged stablecoins like sUSDai or syrupUSDC, DayFi doesn’t use the USD (or any ﬁat) peg. It represents a claim on revenue from a 
portfolio of residential solar and battery systems installed across the U.S. Capital raised through DayFi funds the energy infrastructure, which is 
held by a bankruptcy-remote special purpose vehicle (SPV). Revenue is generated from three primary sources: 
1. Long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with homeowners. 
2. Participation in virtual power plant (VPP) markets. 
3. Government incentives, including tax credits and renewable energy certiﬁcates. 
Payments are metered and contract-based, aggregated into a diversiﬁed, amortizing cash ﬂow portfolio. 
It’s likely we will see more forms and models of exogenous revenue in 2026 and beyond. While crypto users’ base today is quickly accumulating 
tokenized RWAs and seeking exposure to them onchain, these projects could be attractive to non-crypto natives who seek to invest in these unique 
business models.

Demand for loans onchain increased in 2025. Today, 65% of onchain loans are backed by native crypto assets, while 35% are backed by RWAs. 
The majority of RWA-backed loans today are backed by home equity and originate on Figure. While crypto-backed lending onchain remains the 
dominant sector, we project a rise in demand for both categories throughout 2026. 
Crypto-Backed Loans 
While the major lending and borrowing platforms, such as Aave and Morpho, continue to facilitate the majority of crypto-backed loans, growth is 
accelerating for consumer credit for payments.

Demand for crypto cards has risen dramatically, with over $400 million in monthly spending volume (excluding CEX cards) driven by friendly 
regulation that has allowed banks to issue cards for crypto companies. However, the current infrastructure is ineﬃcient. The majority of existing 
crypto cards function as prepaid debit cards. This model forces users to sell their assets to fund the card, triggering taxable events and preventing 
that capital from earning yield in DeFi. 
The next evolution in this sector is the "true credit" model, which allows users to borrow stables against crypto collateral and spend those stables 
oﬀchain. ether.ﬁ card is an example of this mechanism, and it oﬀers two distinct advantages: 
1. Tax Eﬃciency: Users spend cash via a loan rather than liquidating crypto, avoiding capital gains taxes on every transaction. 
2. Capital Eﬃciency: The deposited crypto remains in a vault where it continues to earn yield, oﬀsetting the cost of credit. 
Additionally, ether.ﬁ sets the parameters for what collateral is accepted into the vault (USDC, USDT, DAI, USDe) and uses a strategy manager 
(Seven Seas) to safely allocate collateral into DeFi with professional risk management. The vault has managed to avoid any liquidations, a crucial

requirement for consumers to consider DeﬁBanks as a replacement for traditional banks. 
If platforms can successfully introduce no/low-cost loans backed by crypto at scale, they will oﬀer a capital-eﬃcient alternative that could replace 
traditional bank accounts. 
RWA-backed Loans 
RWA-backed loans onchain are currently dominated by home equity, with the vast majority of loans originating on Figure. We believe that home 
equity loans will grow, as will other forms of private credit, such as merchant lending. 
 
Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) have proven to be the most successful RWA implementation to date. Figure users alone account for $14.1 
billion in active home equity loans. The onchain model oﬀers tangible beneﬁts over traditional banking by creating a transparent marketplace that 
reduces origination time. These eﬃciencies allow lenders to pass down an average of 1.25% in cost savings to borrowers. 
While Figure is the largest non-bank HELOC lender globally, the debt issued on its underlying Provenance blockchain exists in isolation from the

broader DeFi ecosystem. Holders of this debt cannot currently leverage it in a composable manner. We expect this to change in 2026 as protocols 
develop bridges to bring these assets onchain, such as Kamino Multiply, which will allow this substantial RWA collateral to ﬂow into general 
DeFi liquidity pools 
We anticipate there will also be demand for RWA-backed loans from merchants. Many small businesses struggle with 30-60 day settlement times, 
and have less cash on hand as a result. U.S.-based merchants may have an easier time securing loans, given the maturity of U.S. banking 
infrastructure and the depth of liquidity available. However, international merchants may struggle to obtain the same level of liquidity from their 
local banks and access the same loans as U.S. merchants.

Global merchant cash advances are expected to grow at a 6.6% CAGR over the next four years. While U.S. merchants beneﬁt from deep banking 
infrastructure, international merchants often face insurmountable hurdles due to the lack of standardized credit scoring and local liquidity. 
Creditworthiness assessment remains subjective and fragmented across diﬀerent jurisdictions.

Additionally, creditworthiness varies by country, and the creditworthiness of a company can also be subjective, depending on the organization that 
evaluates it. Merchants could beneﬁt from a single standard, programmatic evaluation, and automated allocation of private credit based on cash 
ﬂow. 
Onchain credit protocols resolve this by establishing a single, programmatic standard for evaluating creditworthiness based on transparent onchain 
cash ﬂow. This automated allocation of private credit can service the rising demand from international merchants who are currently underserved 
by their local banking systems. 
DeﬁBanking 
Neobanks have disrupted consumer ﬁnance by eliminating physical branches and oﬀering sleek, mobile-ﬁrst interfaces. These products lowered 
fees, improved user experience, and unlocked access to ﬁnancial services for millions. But under the hood, neobanks remained tightly coupled to 
legacy infrastructure. Most rely on partner banks for custody and payments, meaning user funds are siloed inside omnibus accounts, constrained 
by settlement delays, and ultimately governed by traditional rails. 
Centralized exchanges (CEXs) have extended the neobank model to the crypto space. They dominate ﬁat onramps, hold the majority of circulating 
stablecoins, and provide a wide suite of ﬁnancial services. However, their custodial structure means they inherit many of the same limitations as 
neobanks, including permissioned access, delayed ﬁnality, and opaque risk models. Today, no product oﬀers a fully onchain banking experience 
end-to-end. 
A DeﬁBank is a non-custodial crypto bank. It reconstructs traditional ﬁnancial services using decentralized protocols, allowing users to save, 
spend, earn, and borrow through self-custodial infrastructure. Unlike CEXs or neobanks, a DeﬁBank does not rely on a banking license or 
third-party custody. Therefore, user funds are held directly in bearer assets, such as stablecoins, that settle atomically onchain and can be veriﬁed 
by anyone. Because funds are self-custodied and stablecoins should be backed 1:1, DeﬁBanks cannot operate on a fractional reserve banking 
model. 
DeﬁBanks shift the trust model from "trust the institution" to "verify the code." Settlement takes seconds, not days. Treasury revenue from 
stablecoins or payment rails can be returned to users. Access is governed by protocols, not institutions. The result is a ﬁnancial system that is 
transparent, eﬃcient, and global by default. 
How a DeﬁBank Works

Traditional banks and neobanks primarily focus on four key behaviors: saving, spending, earning, and borrowing. DeﬁBanks replicate each of 
these pillars using onchain tools. 
1. Save 
Saving is the foundational use case of any bank. Traditional institutions monetize deposits by lending them out, while oﬀering users a fraction of 
the returns. Neobanks improved the interface, but still route deposits through partner banks, meaning users exchange ownership for IOUs. 
DeﬁBanks retain the self-custody model. Stablecoin deposits are backed 1:1, stored in the user’s wallet, and the yield can be distributed 
transparently. They may leverage intermediaries like Bridge to manage compliance or ﬁat conversion, but the savings product itself is

## Page 217

216 
non-custodial. Unlike traditional models, DeﬁBanks use yield as a loss leader to attract liquidity, then monetize across higher-margin verticals. 
2. Spend 
Most neobanks and CEXs rely on prepaid debit cards for crypto spending. These cards convert assets to ﬁat and route them through the same 
costly intermediaries that underpin credit card networks. Every $100 spent might cost a merchant $2 or more. 
DeﬁBanks start with the same infrastructure: partner banks, Cards-as-a-Service platforms, and stablecoin orchestrators. However, the ultimate 
goal is peer-to-peer wallet payments that bypass card networks entirely. With onchain send functions, users can transfer funds directly to 
merchants at near-zero cost. While this reduces per-transaction revenue, it opens the door for DeﬁBanks to capture the entire payments stack and 
reroute savings to both merchants and users. 
3. Earn 
Neobanks collapsed the boundary between savings and brokerage by embedding investment products in a single interface. This unlocked new 
revenue streams, but most rely on payment for order ﬂow or spread-based monetization. 
DeﬁBanks earn revenue from DEX protocol fees, order routing, and user ﬂow. These margins are meaningfully higher than those of traditional 
banks, particularly among “fee-insensitive” users who prioritize convenience and security. Some wallets generate over $8.00 per $1,000 in trading 
volume, a sharp contrast to legacy brokers. 
DeﬁBanks can also manage MEV internally, routing transactions directly to searchers or private relays to reduce slippage and protect user 
execution. This vertical generates high-frequency, high-margin revenue with minimal balance sheet risk. 
4. Borrow 
Borrowing unlocks liquidity from existing capital, either by posting collateral or underwriting creditworthiness. Traditional banks dominate this 
vertical through mortgages and credit cards. Neobanks, without banking licenses, are largely excluded. 
DeﬁBanks combine onchain collateral with oﬀchain attestations. A DeﬁBank can underwrite loans using a user’s token holdings, DeFi activity, 
escrowed RWAs, or even veriﬁed oﬀchain cash ﬂows. As zk-proof infrastructure and decentralized identity mature, users may unlock more 
favorable rates by building a “trust score” that travels with them across applications. 
This approach supports new markets, such as immigrant mortgages, undercollateralized lending, and portfolio-based credit. The opportunity is 
massive as U.S. mortgage debt exceeds $13 trillion and global unsecured credit tops $5 trillion. A system that can oﬀer transparent, programmable 
credit lines with veriﬁable solvency presents a meaningful threat to legacy lenders.

CEXs remain the dominant neobanks in crypto. They control user onboarding, custody, and trading. However, DeFi banks are now viable 
alternatives because their infrastructure is catching up, and their fundamental economics are superior. 
Three key factors give DeﬁBanks an edge: 
1. Yield Advantage: DeFi-native stablecoin funds generate higher returns than marketing-subsidized neobank yields. Products like USDai 
and DayFi employ strategies such as treasury yields, delta-neutral trading, and collateralized debt. These funds are onchain, composable, 
and programmable.

## Page 219

2. Cost Structure: By bypassing payment processors and card networks, DeﬁBanks eliminate layers of fees. Smart contracts execute 
settlement directly. The only cost is gas, which can often be rebated or subsidized. This unlocks new pricing models and merchant 
economics that traditional banks cannot match. 
3. Global Access: A DeﬁBank works anywhere with an internet connection. While ﬁat onramps still present a challenge, aggregators like 
Transak, MoonPay, and Ramp are closing that gap. In the long term, permissionless infrastructure will onboard users in Nigeria, Argentina, 
or the Philippines just as easily as it does in the U.S. or EU. 
The neobank revolution was built on a better interface. The DeﬁBank revolution is built on a better backend. 
By combining self-custody with composable yield, programmable payments, and real-time ﬁnality, DeﬁBanks oﬀer a full-stack alternative to both 
neobanks and CEXs. Although the model is still evolving, its structural advantages are evident. As stablecoin infrastructure expands and 
regulation provides clarity, DeﬁBanks may become the dominant distribution layer for crypto banking services. 
There is no reason a savings account, trading app, credit card, and remittance platform cannot be bundled into a single permissionless wallet. In 
fact, DeﬁBanks already exist—they just need to be packaged and scaled.

Introduction 
In traditional markets, AI has unquestionably been the hottest sector of 2025. The S&P 500 has seen a continuation of a multi-year trend, with 
recent reports revealing that since the release of ChatGPT in 2022, AI-related stocks have gained 165%, compared to just 24% for non-AI stocks 
over the same period. 
In private markets, venture capital continues to ﬂow aggressively into the sector. AI investment in the ﬁrst three quarters of 2025 was 62% higher 
than the full-year total for 2024, and 135% higher than in 2023. In Q3 alone, AI deals accounted for 63% of all U.S. VC funding. 
However, investor interest in decentralized AI (“deAI”) hasn’t kept pace with broader AI enthusiasm. Since peaking at 16% in Q3 2024, deAI’s 
share of total crypto venture investment has been on a downward trajectory, falling to just 9% in Q3 2025. Public markets have reﬂected a similar 
sentiment, with the sector’s share of the total altcoin market cap falling 56% since the beginning of the year. 
Despite lackluster investor interest, the sector is arguably better positioned than ever. Major trends in the broader AI industry are providing 
external tailwinds that we believe will signiﬁcantly accelerate adoption and innovation across the deAI stack: 
● Data: As public data sources are exhausted, new frontier use cases emerge, and post-training becomes a key focus, the demand for 
specialized, high-quality datasets is rising. Cryptoeconomic structures enable collection to scale rapidly while preserving privacy and 
provenance. 
● Compute: The relentless demand for compute, combined with the advancing capabilities of open-source models, is opening new demand 
vectors and enabling novel architectures for decentralized compute networks (“DCNs”). 
● Training: Advancements in test-time compute scaling with reinforcement learning have unlocked decentralized training methods that can 
produce highly capable models. 
● Agents: As autonomous agents become increasingly integrated into the digital economy, emerging standards such as x402 and ERC-8004 
are establishing crypto as the optimal infrastructure for agentic ﬁnance. 
Furthermore, AI is increasingly embedding itself into the crypto economy. This impact can be felt at every layer of the stack, from smart contract 
development and security up through consumer DeFi front-ends. 
The thesis is simple: Decentralized AI’s Age of Enlightenment is upon us. Let’s dive in. 
The Compute Economy 
In late September, Citigroup raised its forecast for data infrastructure spending to surpass $2.8 trillion through 2029, roughly in line with 
NVIDIA’s projection of $3-4 trillion by 2030. These numbers directly reﬂect the AI industry’s insatiable appetite for compute. In recent months, 
GPUs have become bargaining chips in international aﬀairs, and any information about who’s buying and selling them to whom sends shockwaves 
throughout public markets.

But, why is compute in such high demand? Without getting too far in the weeds, demand for compute is a function of the three scaling laws in AI: 
● Pre-training Scaling: Increasing training dataset size, model parameter count, and compute leads to predictable improvements in model 
intelligence and accuracy. 
● Post-training Scaling: Models can continue to improve in accuracy, eﬃciency, and specialization after initial pre-training by utilizing 
techniques such as ﬁne-tuning and reinforcement learning. 
● Test-time Scaling: At inference time, models can leverage various methodologies that use more compute per query to achieve better 
results. 
 
Leading AI labs aim to squeeze every last drop of juice from these laws, with the compute required to train frontier models increasing by roughly 
4-5x per year, according to EpochAI. However, training is just the ﬁrst step. Once models are in production, the demands of model usage, i.e., 
inference, begin to kick in. 
Inference demand has skyrocketed over the past year. In addition to the baseline demand driven by rapidly rising AI adoption, this trend has

been further ampliﬁed by the immense popularity of reasoning models. Reasoning models combine RL-trained deliberation with test-time scaling, 
enabling performance to improve by “thinking longer.” This results in using up to 10x more tokens to respond to the same prompts as 
non-reasoning models. Downstream of these models are agents, which frequently use an even greater number of tokens due to tool calls. 
In January, the release of one reasoning model in particular changed the course of open-source model development and usage: DeepSeek-R1. R1 
demonstrated that open-source models could rival the performance of top-tier closed models, such as OpenAI's o1 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, in 
high-value tasks like coding. Since R1, the open-source landscape has seen a proliferation of highly capable models, compounding on the 
innovations brought about by DeepSeek. 
AI companies constantly balance inference cost and performance, striving to optimize the user experience while maximizing their margins. This 
has led many companies to transition to open-source models, which consistently account for roughly 30% of OpenRouter traﬃc. Leading 
Inference-as-a-Service companies Together.ai and Fireworks have capitalized on this, each generating over nine ﬁgures in annual recurring 
revenue this year, with a substantial portion coming from serving open-source model inference. 
This brings us to decentralized compute networks. 
A Whole New World 
In past years, decentralized compute networks (“DCNs”) have struggled to ﬁnd product-market ﬁt. DCNs positioned themselves as cheaper 
alternatives to leading cloud providers, such as AWS and Azure; however, even during the 2023 GPU shortages, customers never came knocking. 
These networks couldn’t capitalize on the newly rising demand for inference because closed-source models had too great a lead over open-source 
models. 
DCNs now ﬁnd themselves in a comﬁer environment. With a surplus of highly capable open-source models and soaring demands for inference, 
these networks are presented with two new avenues for monetization to supplement their GPU cloud business.

First, networks can attempt to carve out a wedge in the retail Inference-as-a-Service market, competing against consumer-facing platforms like 
Together.ai or Fireworks. This year, multiple DCNs have launched products in this vein: io.net released IO Intelligence on February 12, and Akash 
launched AkashML on November 24. However, only Chutes has seen breakout adoption, scaling from 410 million tokens per day in late January to 
consistently processing over 100 billion tokens per day. 
This ﬁrst path is challenging. It forces DCNs to compete not just on price, but also on Developer Experience (DX) and reliability, areas where 
centralized providers have historically excelled. 
The second avenue is for DCNs to focus on becoming a wholesale supply layer for the industry. Rather than ﬁghting for individual developers, 
DCNs can focus on aggregating raw compute supply to sell in bulk to Inference-as-a-Service startups. This allows the DCN to specialize in 
low-cost supply generation, while leaving user acquisition, veriﬁcation, and API management to specialized aggregators. 
Crucially, networks that pursue this path will need to prioritize veriﬁcation. API providers will only integrate decentralized supply if they can 
cryptographically guarantee the integrity of the compute without sacriﬁcing performance. 
Verifying Inference

223 
Veriﬁable inference provides proof that model outputs correspond exactly to those generated by the speciﬁed model, using the supplied data and 
following the prescribed computation steps. 
In high-stakes contexts such as ﬁnancial decision-making or medical diagnostics, reliability and transparency are non-negotiable. Similarly, 
developers who pay handsomely to access leading models need assurance that they are receiving the genuine product and expected performance. 
This is especially crucial for DCNs, as users place their trust in a distributed network of contributors worldwide. 
Three primary approaches have emerged to address veriﬁability, zkML, Optimistic ML, and teeML, each with their own trade-oﬀs across cost, 
latency, and security: 
● zkML: zkML uses cryptographic proofs to verify that an inference was computed correctly without revealing the underlying model or data. 
It oﬀers the strongest guarantee, but introduces signiﬁcantly higher cost and latency. 
● Optimistic ML: Optimistic ML assumes inferences are valid unless challenged by “watchers” who can submit fraud proofs if an error is 
detected. It’s cheaper than zkML but still ineﬃcient, as users must wait through a challenge period before results are ﬁnalized. 
● teeML: teeML involves deploying LLM models within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and providing onchain attestations for 
computations. While this approach is far cheaper and faster than other alternatives, it still comes with some trust assumptions, such as 
proper TEE and program conﬁguration. 
Outside of intentional tampering, veriﬁcation is further complicated by the non-deterministic nature of AI. Even when the same model processes 
identical inputs on the same hardware, results can vary. Some sources of variability are controllable, but others, such as those stemming from 
ﬂoating-point arithmetic, have proved much more challenging.

This year, EigenCloud extended their stack to include two new veriﬁable compute services: 
● EigenAI: A veriﬁable LLM inference API that combines cryptoeconomic veriﬁcation with a technical breakthrough enabling deterministic 
processing. 
● EigenCompute: A veriﬁable oﬀchain compute service that allows developers to run applications or agents within a trusted execution 
environment (TEE). Each deployment is recorded onchain and assigned a unique wallet. 
Unlocking deterministic inference is a big deal, and positions Eigen well to handle agentic ﬁnance use cases, where consistent execution is key. 
Builders are already working in some of these areas since its release: 
● Prediction Market Agents: Agents capable of interpreting real-world data to execute bets or resolve markets. 
● Trading Agents: Agents that reason over data with veriﬁable reasoning quality, ensuring prompts remain unmodiﬁed and trades are 
executed deterministically. 
Other DCNs have approached the veriﬁability issue in a variety of ways, with many settling on TEEs, such as Chutes, Phala, and io.net.

New Architectures for Inference 
Another trend in open-source this year has been the increasing intelligence of smaller models. Recently, we’ve seen models with between four 
billion and 40 billion parameters catching up to models nearly ten times their size. Unlike large language models that require expensive hardware 
to run, these models can be run on consumer-grade GPUs, unlocking new network architectures. 
 
These emerging network architectures coordinate small models running on dispersed, heterogeneous consumer hardware to serve inference. The 
core thesis is that by utilizing ranking and reputation systems among specialized nodes, the network can, in aggregate, produce superior responses 
compared to a single monolithic model. 
Fortytwo, a protocol built on Monad, scales inference using this approach by networking small language models (SLMs) across consumer laptops 
and desktops. The protocol leverages idle computing power to run decentralized inference tasks in the background, allowing users to contribute to 
the network without disrupting their primary device usage.

## Page 227

Functionally, the system distributes a single prompt across multiple nodes. These nodes independently generate responses and then rank each 
other’s outputs, eventually merging the best results into a ﬁnal consensus answer. Nodes accrue reputation based on how closely their evaluations 
align with the consensus ranking. This reputation is incrementally updated onchain, allowing the network to weigh high-quality nodes more 
heavily in future tasks. 
Beyond standard inference, the network creates a data ﬂywheel. Nodes collaboratively generate domain-speciﬁc question-and-answer pairs, which 
serve as training data for specialized open-source SLMs. These ﬁne-tuned models are then integrated back into the network, creating a 
self-evolving swarm that grows smarter with every iteration. 
In October, the team released the ﬁrst model trained on this swarm-generated dataset. Strand-Rust-Coder-14B is a Qwen2.5-Coder-14B model 
ﬁne-tuned for Rust programming using 200,000 Q&A pairs generated by the network in just under nine days. The team reports that the model 
achieved 43–48% accuracy on Rust-speciﬁc benchmarks, outperforming signiﬁcantly larger proprietary models on these tasks. 
While initial results have been impressive, Fortytwo acknowledges that the consensus process introduces latency. This naturally narrows the total 
addressable market. However, we expect the protocol could ﬁnd demand in high-stakes verticals where accuracy and reduced hallucination are 
prioritized over raw speed. In this sense, the ideal use cases are ones where "waiting 20 seconds for a 5% better answer" is a feature, not a bug. 
The Path Forward for DCNs 
We believe DCNs are better positioned today than ever before. The explosion of open-source models, paired with surging demand for compute, 
has fundamentally altered the trajectory for these networks. Unlike previous cycles, they’re now well-equipped to capitalize on the growing market 
of small-to-medium-sized AI startups looking for cost-eﬀective ways to scale. 
The coming months will reveal whether the optimal path for inference services is to compete on retail product experience or to focus on wholesale 
supply. Notably, some of the most commercially successful inference-focused DePINs that initially pursued the product route, such as Prodia and 
Hyperbolic, appear to have pivoted toward utilizing centralized compute providers this year. Prodia, for instance, stated this shift was necessary to 
achieve top-tier performance, noting that “GPU is not as commoditized as it seems on paper.” DCNs will have to continue grappling with the 
reality that achieving retail-grade reliability often conﬂicts with using purely decentralized supply. 
Swarm inference, meanwhile, stands in contrast to the broader DCN inference landscape. While most networks compete on developer experience 
(DX), the swarm architecture represents a contrarian bet: sacriﬁcing latency in exchange for accuracy. However, these networks are still in their 
infancy and need to ﬁrst prove that the value proposition holds up when the rubber meets the road. 
Finally, discussions with industry players reveal that a major barrier to scaling is the lingering stigma around crypto. We believe this has forced 
many DCNs to ﬁght an uphill battle on the demand side. Consequently, securing reputable clients serves not just as revenue, but as a critical 
endorsement of trust. This is an underappreciated catalyst that could spark unexpectedly rapid growth.

Data at the Frontier 
As the corpus of untapped publicly available data dries up and frontier use cases accelerate, data requirements are shifting from simple, unimodal 
inputs (such as static images or text) to complex, multimodal formats. 
This shift creates new monetization opportunities for crypto companies that can collect valuable data at scale. At a high level, we categorize these 
networks into two types: 
● Active: Users explicitly perform tasks where data collection is the primary objective. 
● Passive: Data is generated automatically as "digital exhaust" from a user’s existing activity. 
Tracking the exact revenue and partnerships of these companies is challenging, as agreements with large enterprises and frontier labs are typically 
shielded by NDAs. However, given the magnitude of current demand and early traction, we believe these networks are well-positioned to become 
one of the most proﬁtable entities in the decentralized AI stack in 2026. 
Active Data Collection 
As AI evolves, data annotation companies that initially focused on labeling structured, unimodal data, such as basic text for sentiment analysis, are 
expanding their oﬀerings. Nowadays, many of these companies also generate scarce, hard-to-source data, such as robotics demonstrations, niche 
post-training environments, and complex model evaluations. 
The opportunity for these companies is enormous. This year alone, Surge AI reportedly generated $1.4 billion in revenue with a team of just 121 
people and no venture funding. Meanwhile, Scale AI sold a 49% stake to Meta for $14.8 billion, while generating approximately $870 million in 
annual revenue. However, the competition is ﬁerce. Providers that are slow to deliver or fail to meet quality standards risk jeopardizing 
relationships with valuable clients. 
Over the past year, there has been an increase in companies adopting blockchain payment rails and cryptoeconomic structures to gain a 
competitive edge. These implementations typically oﬀer one or more of the following advantages: 
1. Improved Payments: Cross-border stablecoin transactions allow companies to attract supply-side users worldwide with real-time, 
frictionless payments. Additionally, they enable economically viable micropayments, unlocking a granular workforce that traditional 
banking fees would otherwise price out. 
2. Dynamic Incentives: Token-based incentives can be used to fully or partially subsidize payments for work, helping companies bootstrap 
their supply side. 
3. Rapid Scaling: Markets can be spun up instantly to meet long-tail data requests. Optional cryptoeconomic structures can tie compensation 
to performance and reputation, creating mechanisms that deter low-quality participation and encourage sustained, high-quality 
contributions.

Grass was one of the ﬁrst data collection companies to achieve product–market ﬁt by leveraging token incentives to bootstrap supply. The 
company focuses primarily on large-scale multimodal pretraining data, gaining a unique edge through its collection methodology. The network 
utilizes unused user bandwidth to scrape diﬀerentiated data, rewarding passive contributors with tokens for staying online. This year, Grass began 
to ramp up its revenue, scaling from near zero in Q1 to a projected $12.8 million in Q4, driven by repeat business from major AI enterprises. 
Among new entrants, we’re seeing companies carving out initial wedges within speciﬁc domains or modalities, such as Chakra with computer-use 
agents or Posiedon with audio data. 
Currently, the most saturated domain appears to be robotics, which is understandable given the present scarcity and diﬃculty of sourcing data at 
scale. However, we believe that alternative, less crowded frontier domains could provide a better wedge for forming relationships with large 
enterprises and labs. Within that wedge, companies can expand their oﬀering beyond collection and annotation to include high-value RL 
environments or novel benchmarks, dominating the vertical before expanding out. 
Chakra is a prime example of a company deploying this strategy. In late June, Chakra launched Pango, a product designed to crowdsource 
large-scale data for training computer-use agents (CUAs). CUAs operate computers by visually interpreting the interface, reasoning through tasks,

229 
and taking actions via keyboard and mouse. For enterprises, the potential is signiﬁcant as these agents represent a major step forward in 
automating knowledge work. 
Training CUAs requires collecting and transforming real-world recordings of human computer use. However, due to coordination challenges, 
existing open-source training datasets remain severely limited in both scope and scale. Pango addresses this gap through a Chrome extension that 
enables users to earn USDC by recording their screens while completing speciﬁc tasks (e.g., working on a task for ﬁve minutes in Excel). 
Expanding on their eﬀorts in this space, Chakra used its own collected data to train GLADOS-1, the ﬁrst CUA model post-trained using collective, 
crowdsourced trajectories, and released Dojo, a collaborative reinforcement learning environment suite for developing computer-use agents. 
Passive Data Collection 
Unlike active data collection, passive data collection occurs when data generation is a secondary eﬀect of a company’s primary product or service 
oﬀering. The friction is near zero, allowing for massive scale. One of the most promising examples emerging this year is Shaga.

## Page 231

Shaga is a DePIN network that turns idle gaming PCs into a distributed cloud gaming platform from users providing their computing power. As a 
byproduct, Shaga also produces Gameplay-Action Pair (GAP) data, which is a synchronized data package that contains two fundamental 
components: 
● Gameplay (Frames): A sequence of video frames capturing the in-game visual output. 
● Action (Controls): The corresponding sequence of player inputs (e.g., keystrokes, mouse movements, controller actions) that directly 
caused those visual frames to be rendered. 
Unlike a standard gameplay video scraped from a streaming site, a GAP dataset provides a direct, veriﬁable link between a player's intent (the 
action) and its consequence (the gameplay). This raw material can be used to teach world models spatial-temporal reasoning, a cognitive ability 
that enables understanding and manipulation of objects in space and time. 
GAP data has a wide range of potential valuations. Internal estimates place a conservative ﬂoor at $1 per hour, while market intelligence indicates 
that data brokers are quoting rates between $50 and $100 per hour. Based on these estimates, Shaga's 259,400 hours of collected gaming data has 
an estimated valuation of up to ~$26 million. 
Regardless of the precise value, OpenAI’s $500 million acquisition oﬀer to gaming company Medal last year provides a benchmark for how 
desirable this data is. If Shaga can continue to scale their network, we believe that the network will be incredibly well-positioned to capitalize on 
the popularity of world models across multiple domains, such as robotics and real-time generated games. 
Competitive Dynamics & Compounding 
As mentioned above, many of the deals these companies are signing include NDAs, limiting their ability to be fully transparent about the state of 
the business. This presents an interesting opportunity. For those who understand the competitive dynamics at play and can identify winners, the 
upside surprise from revenue announcements or partnership disclosures can be signiﬁcant. 
Ultimately, competition in this ﬁeld comes down to data quality and turnaround time. Companies that build robust, scalable quality control 
systems are best positioned to compound growth through high-value partnerships, once they get a foot in the door. But getting in the door is 
challenging. Leading AI companies are ﬂooded with inquiries, and often the most eﬀective approach is to identify a speciﬁc area of demand, 
develop deep expertise in that domain, send a targeted sample dataset, and deepen trust one dataset at a time. 
We believe the year ahead will bring increased attention to this sector as more companies begin announcing partnerships with “leading AI labs” 
(yes, it will very likely be vague). Additionally, we expect to see a growing number of traditional companies integrating cryptoeconomic 
incentives and stablecoin rails to capitalize on the competitive advantages that crypto can oﬀer. 
Decentralized Training Actually Works 
Looking back at last year’s thesis from today’s vantage point makes it abundantly clear just how much progress has been made in this area. DeAI

labs have transitioned from testing initial methodologies in controlled settings to releasing competitive, mid-sized open models trained on 
heterogeneous GPUs distributed globally. While a full accounting of this past year’s training accomplishments exceeds the scope of this segment, 
we’ll ﬁrst go over the highlights from a few of the sector’s leading labs. 
Prime Intellect 
In 2025, Prime Intellect (“Prime”) leaned fully into the broader shift toward test-time compute with reinforcement learning. Major releases this 
year included SYNTHETIC-1 and SYNTHETIC-2, decentralized runs to generate datasets of veriﬁed reasoning traces, INTELLECT-2, one of the 
ﬁrst 32 billion parameter model post-trained via globally distributed RL, and INTELLECT-3, a 106 billion parameter model that achieves 
state-of-the-art performance for its size across math, code, science, and reasoning benchmarks. Alongside these releases, the team open-sourced 
various infrastructure for deAI development, including TOPLOC, Prime Collective Communications Library, and the Environments Hub. 
In February, the team secured $15 million in funding, with participation from some of the most inﬂuential voices in AI, including Andrej 
Karpathy, Clem Delangue, and Dylan Patel. While this funding provides the company with the necessary resources to continue focusing on 
growth, Prime has also stated that it’s actively exploring novel revenue models centered around licensing markets for models and agents. 
Nous Research 
Like many of the other leading deAI labs, Nous has notably leaned into the RL paradigm. In February, they released DeepHermes 3 Preview, a 
model that uniﬁed reasoning and intuitive language capabilities. Soon after, they introduced Atropos, an asynchronous RL framework that allows 
developers to train models in either custom-built environments or the pre-existing ones available in the repo. 
After Atropos, Nous released their most signiﬁcant project of the year: Psyche Network, a decentralized training orchestrator that builds upon 
their earlier optimization methods, DeMO and DisTrO. The network integrates Solana for node coordination and event logging, with training 
rewards expected in future updates.

By August, Hermes 4 launched as a full line of hybrid reasoning models, leveraging Atropos for various training stages. Alongside these models, 
Nous released a new benchmark, RefusalBench, which tests a model’s willingness to be helpful in various scenarios commonly disallowed by 
both closed and open models. Prompts related to minor speciﬁc harm, 
exploitation and human traﬃcking, and suicide/self-harm were selected as categories for conditional reward inversion, meaning refusals are scored 
positively. 
Most recently, Nous has released Hermes 4.3, a post-trained ByteDance Seed 36B model that was fully trained on the Psyche Network. 
Gensyn 
This year, Gensyn unveiled the results of years of behind-the-scenes development. Over the course of 2025, the team released a series of papers 
detailing various methodologies that underpin their protocol, such as Verde, SkipPipe, and CheckFree. 
The protocol is currently transitioning from testnet to mainnet, with a few core apps that users can engage with: 
● RL Swarm: A framework for collaborative reinforcement learning over the internet.

## Page 234

233 
● BlockAssist: An open-source AI assistant that learns from your Minecraft gameplay, training locally and running on your device. 
● Judge: A veriﬁable evaluation framework built on Verde that can be used for any context where trustworthy evaluation is critical, such as 
prediction markets. 
● Delphi: A prediction market for machine intelligence. Users purchase stakes in speciﬁc models based on their anticipated performance in 
benchmarks, eﬀectively crowdsourcing a live, ﬁnancialized index of model quality. 
Gensyn’s testnet saw strong participation, with over 500,000 models trained across all applications. As of December 17, the protocol is two days 
into its English auction token sale with $3.49 million committed at a $115 million FDV. 
Pluralis 
Pluralis is tackling the complexities of using model-parallelism in pre-training. One motivation behind this approach is to unlock open-source 
monetization. If a model can be trained collaboratively across multiple participants, no single party ever gains access to the complete model. As a 
result, it doesn’t exist in its entirety anywhere and can be monetized. 
In June 2025, Pluralis released its Protocol Models paper, outlining their training methodology and presenting a controlled proof-of-concept run. 
Then in September, Pluralis extended the method into production with Node-0-7.5B run, the ﬁrst multi-party pretrain that ran in a completely 
open, heterogeneous GPU swarm. The run concluded in mid-October, featuring over 300 active participants, with 1,642 individual GPUs 
contributing from 198 cities worldwide. 
Looking forward, the team plans to keep scaling runs, integrating more features from their recent work on asynchronous training, veriﬁcation, 
unextractibility, and context-parallelism. 
Toward Adoption 
While the progress made this year is undoubtedly impressive, one of the elephants in the room is whether these models will actually see 
meaningful adoption. 
So far, the jury is still out. Downloads of Nous’ Hermes 4 line have fallen short of those of previous releases, with the top model in the series 
receiving roughly 13,000 downloads, compared to over 100,000 for earlier models. Meanwhile, Prime Intellect’s INTELLECT-3 has been 
downloaded over 18,000 times since its release on November 26, a 17,000% increase over INTELLECT-2. 
One explanation for this divergence is timing. Nous’ earlier models entered the market before the surge in open-source development that has 
deﬁned this year. Given how crowded the market has become, it’s much harder to stand out these days. Still, for both Prime and Nous, download 
ﬁgures remain well below the millions recorded by the leading open-source models.

On the bright side, many of these models appear well-positioned to capitalize on shifting developer preferences. According to a recent study from 
OpenRouter, medium-sized open-source models (15 billion to 70 billion parameters) are increasingly ﬁnding “model-market ﬁt” as users seek a 
balance between capabilities and eﬃciency. This segment has grown from negligible usage at the start of the year to consistently capturing 
25–30% of weekly open-source model activity on OpenRouter. 
Furthermore, users are showing an increasing willingness to experiment with new architectures. Since early September, no single model has 
consistently held more than 20–25% of OSS token volume. This suggests that if a lab can release a suﬃciently diﬀerentiated (and performant) 
model, it can quickly capture the community's attention. 
Innovation & Monetization 
At this stage, we believe the tools used to build these models are more likely to see widespread adoption than the models themselves. With each 
successive release, labs are open-sourcing more of their training infrastructure, including the frameworks, libraries, and tools used throughout the 
training process. While external adoption of these tools has been limited so far, we expect it to grow as these oﬀerings mature into a more 
cohesive and complete stack. 
However, another (much larger) elephant in the room is the question of whether these companies can establish a path to sustainable revenue. Each

lab is currently taking a diﬀerent approach. Prime Intellect oﬀers GPU rentals through a standard Neocloud model. Nous monetizes through API 
credits and a chat-based subscription. Gensyn takes a percentage of fees for tasks completed on its network. And Pluralis… well, they’re just 
getting started. While revenue numbers are not publicly available, we believe current amounts are likely modest. 
That said, these labs are likely well-capitalized enough to get through 2026 without needing to focus heavily on monetization. Prime raised $15 
million in February, Nous raised $50 million in April, Pluralis raised $7.6 million in March, and Gensyn is midway through their token sale at the 
time of writing. And besides, Ilya said we’re back to the age of research. 
Still, we believe we’ll see early productization as these labs begin laying the groundwork for more substantial monetization in the future. 
The Agents Are Here 
The deﬁning narrative of deAI last year was the agent mania that took hold of the market in Q4'24. The market indiscriminately bid up agent 
tokens like aixbt and Zerebro, despite oﬀering little more than a provocative X account. As expected, the euphoria turned to panic when the 
mini-bubble burst. The emperor had no clothes, and the market responded accordingly. 
In hindsight, it’s ironic (or ﬁtting?) that 2025’s ﬁnal hurrah of deAI retail interest came less than a month before the release of DeepSeek-R1, an 
event that sparked a wave of open-source development and positioned deAI in a much more favorable environment. Nevertheless, the agent sector 
continued to march forward, shedding the dead weight of opportunistic participants while solidifying its role in both the traditional digital 
economy and the crypto economy. 
Powering The Agent Economy 
As more users leverage AI for everyday tasks, the digital interface that powers commerce is gradually shifting from search to AI, with agents 
compressing the product discovery and purchasing process. McKinsey states that by 2030, the U.S. B2C retail market alone could see up to $1 
trillion in orchestrated revenue from agentic commerce, with global projections reaching as high as $3 trillion to $5 trillion. 
Leading AI labs and payments companies are acutely aware of this opportunity. In September, several organizations released agentic payment 
protocols, most notably Google’s AP2 and OpenAI’s ACP. Built in collaboration with Stripe, ACP focuses on in-chat commerce, while AP2 
enables secure transactions across all agentic payment scenarios. Whereas ACP is product-driven, AP2 serves as a broader standard that supports 
an autonomous agent-to-agent economy, one with the potential to run on crypto rails. 
While traditional payment rails, such as pay-by-card systems with ﬁxed transaction fees, can suﬃce for human-initiated purchases of goods and 
services, these systems are poorly suited to support a digital economy driven by agent-to-agent interactions that require high-frequency, low-cost 
transactions. 
Both crypto-native and traditional businesses recognize this bottleneck. Over the past several months, ﬁntech and AI companies have increasingly 
positioned themselves to capitalize on the integration of stablecoins into agentic commerce:

● Building: Stripe’s stablecoin-focused blockchain, Tempo, is explicitly designed to accommodate agent payments, with Anthropic and 
OpenAI among its initial design partners. 
● Funding: On September 2, Kite AI, a purpose-built blockchain for agent payments, announced an $18 million Series A round led by 
PayPal Ventures. 
● Collaborating: Google’s AP2 standard includes Coinbase, Circle, Questﬂow, MetaMask, and other crypto companies among its 60+ 
payments and technology partners. 
During this time, one protocol has come to deﬁne the sector: x402. 
 
Developed by Coinbase and launched in May, x402 leverages the existing HTTP 402 code to enable programmatic payments over HTTP via a 
request–response ﬂow. When a client requests a paid resource, the server responds with payment requirements that can be fulﬁlled via blockchain 
rails. This design unlocks instant, per-request payments for content and services, such as data access or AI model inference, initiated by humans 
or agents. Though x402 is still new, it has already been adopted by leading tech enterprises, including Google (through an AP2 extension) and

Cloudﬂare (via their Agents SDK and MCP integration) 
In mid-October, x402 caught ﬁre within the crypto community. Daily transactions climbed from fewer than 5,000 to a peak of 3.9 million on 
November 3, as a growing crypto-native ecosystem emerged to support its expansion. This ﬁrst surge was driven by speculative activity, as people 
bid up memecoins minted through the protocol. However, amid the frenzy of speculation, some real-world use cases have begun to emerge. 
The most distinct advantage x402 holds over traditional card networks is its ability to facilitate micropayments. Early data indicates that organic 
usage is already coalescing around this value proposition: top protocols are now processing millions of low-value transactions for high-frequency, 
on-demand utilities, such as AI inference and agentic services. 
However, to unlock broader adoption, the network must address critical friction points, including trust and discovery. 
Currently, the EVM is positioning itself as the de facto onchain layer for agent identity and reputation via ERC-8004. This proposed standard 
extends Google’s Agent2Agent Protocol by adding a layer of onchain identity, reputation, and veriﬁability. The protocol leverages an ERC-721 
Identity Registry to make agents immediately discoverable and transferable across applications, allowing them to advertise speciﬁc endpoints and 
cross-chain identities. To establish trust, the system integrates Reputation and Validation Registries that store transparent, onchain feedback scores 
and enable independent veriﬁcation of agent work through mechanisms like zkML and TEEs. 
While x402 holds the potential to radically transform the digital economy, widespread adoption will take time, as it hinges on high-value 
integrations across both the client and server sides. For servers, this will require implementing infrastructure that bridges the gap between 
traditional payment systems and crypto. Setups like Bridge’s integrations with Stripe are best positioned to facilitate this adoption, providing 
traditional companies with tools to easily integrate stablecoin payments. On the client side, adoption could signiﬁcantly accelerate through 
payment integrations into leading chat interfaces, a probable development given the current direction of AI labs and their work on agentic 
payments. 
DeFAI Begins to Fulﬁll Its Promise 
Early this year, we saw budding experimentation at the intersection of AI agents and DeFi, a sector often referred to as “DeFAI.” In our February 
report on the sector, we segmented the stack into three distinct layers (reasoning, execution, and abstraction) and outlined four primary use cases 
being explored: Alpha Agents, Execution Agents, AI-Enabled Abstraction, and Portfolio Optimization. 
At the time, most products were essentially proof-of-concepts. Since then, the sector has transitioned to full production mode. While many early 
projects have quietly shut down shop, others have remained heads down, relentlessly shipping new features and iterating on their product (shout 
out Bankr). 
Additionally, new subsectors are seeing meaningful adoption. Yield optimization agents are ﬁnding product-market ﬁt among retail and 
institutional clients, growing assets under management from tens of thousands to tens of millions. Leading the sector, Giza has generated over 
$3.2 billion in transaction volume across more than 57,000 individual agents, attracting capital from top crypto ﬁrms like Re7. While the protocol

began with a stablecoin yield optimization oﬀering, it has since expanded to complex Pendle strategies—a shift we believe oﬀers signiﬁcantly 
more value and diﬀerentiation. 
 
Another subsector gaining traction is AI co-pilots. Companies like True North and Surf oﬀer intelligence products that synthesize onchain and 
oﬀchain data to help users navigate markets. For these companies, data is the ultimate competitive diﬀerentiator. Well-constructed data ﬂywheels 
can rapidly improve underlying systems, creating compounding eﬀects that strengthen defensibility. 
Looking forward, we believe there are several possible outcomes for the sector: Vertical Integration, Embedded AI, and Modular Orchestration. 
Vertical Integration 
In this scenario, specialized platforms vertically integrate adjacent DeFAI services. For example, a research co-pilot might integrate native trading 
execution, yield farming, and portfolio management directly into its product. This strategy is analogous to the Bloomberg Terminal model, where 
data, analysis, and execution reside within a single walled garden. If a platform can execute this, it creates a signiﬁcant competitive advantage, 
fueling a data ﬂywheel that makes the product indispensable to users.

239 
Embedded AI 
Rather than new DeFAI apps winning users, existing dominant interfaces (like Phantom, Axiom, or centralized exchanges) will plug into the best 
systems via API. In this outcome, DeFAI projects become silent backend services, while the front-end retains the customer relationship and the 
fees. This is analogous to Apple embedding models from OpenAI or Google directly into the OS rather than building its own. Given that the 
sector is still in its infancy, this could also take the form of an acquisition, where a major wallet or exchange acquires a leading DeFAI startup to 
gain exclusive access to the technology. 
Modular Orchestration 
Instead of monolithic applications, we observe the emergence of aggregation platforms that coordinate thousands of specialized agents, for 
example, distinct agents for yield optimization or sentiment analysis. Users interact with a single 'Master Agent' that routes tasks to the optimal 
specialist, eﬀectively functioning as a composable app store for intelligence. Virtuals has already deployed this strategy, with Butler acting as a 
master agent that commissions speciﬁc Virtuals agents on the user’s behalf. We expect other aggregation platforms, such as Warden, to follow suit. 
These platforms compete to attract agent developers, with this distribution leverage downstream of agent performance, as users will naturally 
gravitate toward the platforms that deliver the best results. 
Looking Ahead 
We believe the greatest opportunity lies in specialized platforms that vertically integrate and reﬁne their reasoning systems as their data ﬂywheel 
strengthens. Consolidating the entire DeFi experience into a single terminal generates a rich stream of user data. This data can be harnessed to 
hyper-personalize the experience using oﬀchain context, such as decision-making patterns, accepted or rejected ideas, and speciﬁc risk 
preferences. 
The result is a powerful lock-in eﬀect: switching platforms would mean starting over with a "cold start" experience that lacks personalization. If a 
"DeFAI terminal" gains meaningful traction, we will likely see leading front-ends pivot toward an embedded AI strategy to defend their 
positioning. 
That said, this shift will take time to materialize. Trust remains a major barrier to the adoption of DeFAI. While users may feel comfortable 
transacting a few hundred dollars, trading with tens of thousands demands robust guardrails. As a result, it is likely that, for now, trades will 
continue to be executed manually through integrations, e.g., Hyperliquid builder codes. 
Darwinian Networks Draw in Top Global Talent 
Darwinian platforms implement competition-based incentive structures to coordinate resources on a global scale. On these networks, top

performers receive monetary rewards for advancing the ecosystem, while underperforming participants are naturally ﬁltered out. 
This methodology is particularly powerful when applied to the coordination of intelligence. This year, while leading AI companies oﬀered 
hundreds of millions in annual salaries to poach researchers from rival labs, Darwinian networks produced genuinely competitive results through 
permissionless, meritocratic structures. 
Bittensor: The King of Darwinian Platforms 
Bittensor is an ecosystem of independent networks, known as subnets, that address speciﬁc AI tasks through competitive market dynamics. Each 
subnet includes three participants: 
● Owners: Deﬁne the subnet’s incentive mechanism (e.g., rewarding faster inference or higher-quality data). 
● Miners: Compete to deliver the best solutions and earn rewards based on performance. 
● Validators: Evaluate miner performance against the subnet’s criteria and rank participants accordingly. 
In last year’s theses, we cited Bittensor’s Dynamic TAO upgrade as a key development to keep an eye on. We argued that the network has the 
potential to spawn multi-billion-dollar subnets, with the caveat that reaching its full potential requires onboarding top AI talent. A year later, it 
appears that talent acquisition has outpaced demand for subnet tokens. We believe that this presents a signiﬁcant opportunity. 
In 2025, Bittensor’s subnet ecosystem rapidly transitioned from ideation to product. Platforms are seeing strong growth across multiple verticals, 
with over $20 million in annualized revenue generated from compute-focused subnets alone. Meanwhile, research eﬀorts are translating into truly 
decentralized training runs at a global scale, such as IOTA’s Training at Home.

## Page 242

241 
 
One subnet that epitomizes Bittensor’s ability to coordinate intelligence and deliver competitive results is Ridges. Ridges incentivizes the 
development of advanced coding agents through a highly structured and performance-driven platform. The Ridges Platform manages agent 
submissions, orchestrates evaluations, and facilitates real-time communication between miners, screeners, validators, and external services. 
Miners submit open-source agents through the platform, where they are initially screened against ﬁve benchmark problems. Agents that 
successfully solve at least three progress to a full validator evaluation. 
The competition follows a winner-take-all model, with the highest-scoring agent receiving all incentives until surpassed. While uncommon among 
subnets, this model has proven highly eﬀective. Rewards are streamed continuously to the top agent, and holding the number-one spot for just two 
days can yield over $100,000. This structure has created a ﬁercely competitive environment that draws top AI and coding talent, including 
researchers from OpenAI and DeepMind. 
Requiring agents to be open-source has created a powerful ﬂywheel of iteration, enabling Ridges to rapidly surpass their competition. In 
September, Ridges’ leading agent outperformed all open-source competitors on the SWE-bench, the most widely used coding evaluation 
framework, which features 2,294 real-world software engineering problems sourced from GitHub issues. Looking ahead, the Ridges team plans to

productize the subnet via a chat interface, allowing engineers to interact directly with the top-performing agent to solve problems end-to-end. 
Validation from the Outside 
Increasingly, notable organizations across various industries are recognizing the beneﬁts of Darwinian networks. This year, we’ve seen multiple 
industry-leading organizations place their faith in the ability of these networks to deliver superior results. 
Numerai 
Founded in 2019, Numerai is a quantitative market-neutral hedge fund powered by a crowdsourced network of data scientists. At its core is the 
Numerai Tournament, a recurring competition in which participants build machine learning models to predict stock returns using obfuscated 
ﬁnancial datasets. 
Numerai managed roughly $60.0 million in assets in 2022, before scaling to $173.0 million by May 2024 and to over $440.0 million by mid-2025. 
Over the course of 2024, the fund delivered 12 straight positive months and a 25.5% net return. 
In August, Numerai secured a commitment of up to $500 million from JPMorgan Asset Management, marking the ﬁrm’s largest institutional 
backer to date and putting its ﬂagship fund on a path toward nearly $1 billion in deployed capital. 
CrunchDAO 
CrunchDAO connects a global network of ML engineers to enterprises seeking solutions to speciﬁc challenges they face. During a competition, 
participants receive curated, encrypted training datasets from the organization and create models trained with the data. The models are then 
uploaded and ranked based on the scoring function provided by the organization. 
In 2025, CrunchDAO saw steady adoption among the ML community, experiencing 47.5% growth in unique participants, expanding from 7,800 
in January to 10,400 as of October 17. Participants' backgrounds vary widely, from individuals with less than one year of experience working with 
data to PhD-level ML scientists, who currently account for roughly 10% of users. 
On December 9, the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center launched its latest competition, Obesity ML Competition: Tackling Metabolic Diseases, in 
partnership with Broad Diabetes Initiative, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. This is the latest in a 
series of competitions launched by the organization, signaling that CrunchDAO’s model has consistently delivered top-tier results, trusted by the 
world’s leading academics and domain experts. 
Looking Forward 
One of the most persistent challenges the crypto industry faces is the 'trust barrier.' Years of negative publicity (some warranted, some not) have 
made outsiders skeptical of working with crypto companies, placing companies at an immediate competitive disadvantage. This creates a systemic

243 
vicious cycle. Without consistent inﬂows of high-quality talent, the ecosystem remains skewed toward lower-quality actors, which further 
reinforces the stigma. 
We believe Darwinian networks are breaking this loop. Top-tier talent is entering the space, driving results that challenge centralized 
incumbents and attract institutional demand. By establishing legitimacy through this virtuous cycle of talent and demand, they are actively 
destigmatizing the broader industry. 
Given the results we have seen this year, we have strong conviction that this virtuous cycle will continue to strengthen, advancing the maturity and 
reputation of the industry as a whole. 
The Smart Contract Security Dilemma 
AI is a double-edged sword for smart contract development. While AI-assisted coding democratizes the ability to deploy onchain applications, AI 
provides hackers with a powerful tool for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in code. 
This exploitation risk was recently highlighted in a study from Anthropic, where researchers developed a new benchmark that evaluates agents’ 
ability to exploit smart contracts. The benchmark, termed SCONE-bench, comprises 405 smart contracts with real-world vulnerabilities exploited 
between 2020 and 2025. Researchers found that the ten models evaluated collectively produced turnkey exploits for 51% of the problems. The 
total amount of funds stolen in the simulation was $550.1 million… Yikes. 
This study is a rude awakening for the industry. If AI systems start regularly draining millions of dollars from protocols, it will be nearly 
impossible to convince anyone to come onchain. Fortunately, an increasing number of teams are developing AI-driven solutions to prevent attacks 
before they occur. 
From Workﬂow to Post-Deployment 
Platforms like Octane integrate AI-powered security directly into the developer workﬂow. By continuously scanning contracts during development 
and proposing automated ﬁxes, these tools aim to identify vulnerabilities before the code reaches the mainnet. 
Complementing this are AI-native adversarial testing systems such as TestMachine, which apply reinforcement learning and guided fuzzing to 
explore attack surfaces that traditional tools often miss. Instead of checking contracts against known vulnerability patterns, these systems behave 
more like autonomous attackers, searching for novel exploit paths. 
Even with rigorous pre-deployment testing, however, vulnerabilities can and do slip through. This has driven growing demand for runtime security 
and transaction-level enforcement, an area led by platforms like Forta. By monitoring onchain activity in real time and, in some cases, blocking 
high-risk transactions before execution, these systems function as an adaptive ﬁrewall for deployed protocols. 
Looking Forward 
               
 


---

## Page 245

244 
As mentioned above, the SCONE-bench study exposes a capability gap that is widening faster than many realize. However, this presents a distinct 
strategic advantage for the industry. Rather than discovering these vulnerabilities through a series of catastrophic, mainnet-draining events, the 
market has been granted a preview of the threat landscape in a controlled environment. For protocols that understand the competitive dynamics at 
play, this “digital ﬁre drill” oﬀers a brief window to front-run the risk. The ability to harden infrastructure against autonomous agents now, before 
they are weaponized at scale, will likely become a deﬁning factor in preserving protocol treasury and reputation. 
Ultimately, protocol viability in this new era comes down to the sophistication of the defensive stack. We believe the coming cycles will drive a 
fundamental repricing of security, moving it from a pre-deployment checklist to a continuous, active mandate. We expect to see a sharp increase in 
capital allocation toward AI-native defense systems, as teams realize that static audits alone are insuﬃcient against dynamic AI adversaries. 
Integrate these adaptive security layers will be necessary to capture institutional volume, establishing the high-trust environment necessary to 
thrive in an increasingly hostile onchain landscape. 
Prediction Market’s Missing Layer: AI 
Prediction markets have re-emerged as a visible segment of the crypto and ﬁntech landscape, drawing renewed attention from media, 
policymakers, and market participants. Platforms such as Polymarket have demonstrated that onchain event markets can capture real-world 
interest across politics, macroeconomics, sports, and crypto-native events, often generating sharp spikes in activity around major news cycles. In 
recent election cycles, prediction market prices have even been referenced alongside traditional polling and forecasting tools, reinforcing their 
relevance as information signals. 
Despite this visibility, prediction markets remain a marginal category within decentralized ﬁnance. By standard onchain metrics, total value locked 
(TVL), sustained liquidity, and capital eﬃciency, the sector remains small relative to established DeFi primitives such as lending, decentralized 
exchanges, and liquid staking. 
               
 


---

## Page 246

245 
 
This disparity is clear at the category level. As of December 15, total DeFi TVL is approximately $118 billion, with liquid staking protocols 
accounting for roughly $55 billion, lending protocols exceeding $62 billion, and decentralized exchanges holding close to $17 billion. In contrast, 
prediction markets collectively hold around $370 million in TVL, representing well under 1% of total DeFi capital. Even Polymarket, the largest 
prediction market by TVL at roughly $277 million, remains small not only relative to core DeFi sectors but also compared to several newer 
ﬁnancial primitives. While category-level TVL estimates may involve some degree of double-counting, the order-of-magnitude diﬀerence is stable 
and unambiguous.

## Page 247

246 
 
This gap between attention and adoption is structural rather than cyclical. Prediction markets are constrained by binary payoﬀ designs, fragile 
liquidity, and reliance on intermittent human participation. As markets approach resolution, risk concentrates sharply, spreads widen, and order 
books thin. Liquidity provision often depends on short-term subsidies rather than durable participation, limiting scalability and market depth, 
particularly outside of headline events. As a result, prediction markets struggle to support consistent price discovery and capital deployment at 
scale. 
Recent advances in artiﬁcial intelligence introduce a credible mechanism for addressing these constraints. Rather than replacing human judgment 
or governance, AI could be best understood as a new participation layer within prediction markets. Large language models and autonomous agents 
are well-suited to synthesizing global information, updating probabilistic beliefs continuously, and engaging in automated trading behavior. In this 
framing, prediction markets do not primarily need more users; they need more consistent, higher-quality participants. AI has the potential to 
address three structural bottlenecks: information aggregation, liquidity provision, and resolution support. 
Three Areas Where AI Can Enhance Prediction Markets

## Page 248

247 
● Forecasting and Information Aggregation: AI systems can synthesize large volumes of structured and unstructured data into 
probabilistic signals that improve market calibration. 
● Liquidity Provision and Market Participation: Autonomous agents can act as continuous traders or market makers, reducing spreads and 
stabilizing market depth. 
● Resolution and Governance Support: AI can assist oracle and dispute systems by benchmarking outcomes and surfacing relevant 
evidence, without determining ﬁnal truth. 
Information Aggregation and Forecast Quality 
The Current Problem 
Prediction markets rely on participants to ingest dispersed information and translate beliefs into prices. In practice, this process is uneven and 
slow. Human traders face cognitive, informational, and time constraints, particularly in markets that require synthesizing large volumes of 
unstructured data such as news, social media, governance updates, or macro signals. Empirical research on Polymarket data shows persistent 
pricing biases, delayed convergence, and uneven calibration, especially in low-liquidity or long-horizon markets. Prices often reﬂect sentiment and 
attention rather than fully integrated information until late in a market’s lifecycle. These limitations reduce forecast quality and weaken the core 
value proposition of prediction markets as real-time probability estimators. 
How AI Addresses the Problem 
AI systems, particularly large language models and agent-based forecasting systems are structurally aligned with the informational role prediction 
markets require. They can ingest and synthesize vast volumes of structured and unstructured data, including news coverage, social sentiment, 
governance discussions, and historical precedents, and convert these inputs into continuously updated probabilistic beliefs. 
Crucially, AI does not function as an oracle of truth. Instead, it generates signals that are expressed through trading behavior. Market mechanisms 
then discipline these signals through proﬁt and loss, rewarding well-calibrated forecasts and penalizing error. In this framework, AI improves the 
consistency, coverage, and timeliness of information inputs, while the market remains responsible for validating accuracy. 
Early implementations reﬂect this direction. Research and market commentary highlight AI-driven agents actively identifying systematic biases in 
prediction markets, such as favorite–longshot bias, and exploiting mispricings through automated strategies. New platforms and tools increasingly 
frame prediction markets as probabilistic data layers that can be queried, modeled, and traded against algorithmically, rather than as purely 
human-driven betting venues. 
For example, Allora extends this approach by operating a decentralized inference market in which autonomous agents submit probabilistic 
forecasts and are economically rewarded for accuracy over time. The protocol illustrates how decentralized systems can coordinate competing AI 
forecasts through market-based incentives rather than centralized oracle mechanisms 
Synth illustrates how AI forecasting engines are entering prediction markets indirectly, supplying probabilistic signals used by AI-powered trading

systems operating on platforms such as Polymarket and Kalshi. 
Liquidity Provision and Market Participation 
The Current Problem 
Liquidity is the central bottleneck in prediction markets. Binary payoﬀ structures concentrate risk as resolution approaches, discouraging 
sustained participation and leading to thin order books and volatile spreads. Unlike spot or derivative markets where liquidity providers retain 
exposure to assets with residual value, liquidity provision in binary markets involves holding inventories that partially expire worthless at 
settlement. 
Empirical analysis of Polymarket shows that liquidity providers systematically withdraw capital as markets converge, precisely when accurate 
price discovery is most valuable. This dynamic increases slippage, slows convergence, and limits the market’s ability to absorb large trades, 
constraining prediction markets’ scalability and institutional relevance. 
How AI Addresses the Problem 
Autonomous AI agents reduce the cost and friction of continuous participation. Unlike human traders, agents can quote prices persistently, update 
beliefs with low latency, and operate across many markets simultaneously. When multiple agents with heterogeneous models and priors interact, 
they generate arbitrage pressure that tightens spreads and improves market depth. 
Academic work on prediction market liquidity shows that forecast accuracy improves materially with deeper and more stable liquidity. AI agents 
help address this constraint by making market-making and arbitrage economically viable without requiring constant human attention. While AI 
does not eliminate the structural risks of binary outcomes, it lowers participation costs and enables more continuous, disciplined trading behavior. 
In practice, AI functions as a participation layer, stabilizing markets through sustained engagement rather than episodic human involvement. 
Gnosis provides agent-native infrastructure through its long-standing work on prediction markets (e.g., conditional tokens), automation tooling 
(e.g., Safe modules), and experimentation with autonomous agents, positioning it as a natural foundation for AI-driven participation. 
Gnosis-based prediction markets such as Omen and its successor Presagio demonstrate how agent-driven participation can persist longer into a 
market’s lifecycle within LMSR-style designs, supporting engagement without removing the underlying payoﬀ asymmetries of binary markets. 
Resolution and Governance Support 
The Current Problem 
Prediction markets ultimately depend on robust resolution mechanisms to determine outcomes. Onchain platforms rely on oracle systems and 
dispute processes designed to handle ambiguity, incentives, and adversarial behavior. These processes can be slow and information-intensive, 
particularly for complex, subjective, or contested events. 
While decentralization reduces reliance on centralized arbiters, it also increases the burden on participants to gather evidence, interpret outcomes,

249 
and coordinate around resolution. Full automation is neither feasible nor desirable, as many events require judgment and social consensus. 
How AI Addresses the Problem 
AI can support resolution workﬂows without replacing governance. Models can assist by aggregating relevant evidence, benchmarking outcomes 
against historical precedents, identifying inconsistencies across data sources, and ﬂagging anomalous claims during disputes. This reduces 
informational overhead for oracle participants and disputers while preserving incentive alignment and human decision-making. 
Research in AI-driven risk assessment across DeFi demonstrates that models are particularly eﬀective at synthesizing fragmented onchain and 
oﬀchain data, surfacing early warning signals, and improving decision eﬃciency without assuming authority. Applied to prediction markets, these 
same capabilities can improve the scalability and reliability of resolution processes especially as platforms expand into more complex event 
categories. 
In this role, AI enhances governance rather than supplanting it, strengthening trust in outcomes while preserving the core decentralized design of 
prediction markets. 
Early protocol designs reﬂect this support-oriented approach. For example, Opinion integrates AI-assisted tooling into oracle and resolution 
workﬂows to help aggregate evidence, evaluate complex macro data, and reduce informational overhead during market resolution. Importantly, 
these systems do not automate truth determination; instead, they aim to improve the eﬃciency and scalability of existing dispute and governance 
processes while preserving human judgment and incentive alignment. 
Looking Forward 
AI will not replace human judgment in prediction markets, nor should it. Resolution ultimately depends on governance, accountability, and social 
consensus. The role of AI is to strengthen participation, not to determine truth. 
As prediction markets scale, the limits of episodic, human-only participation become increasingly binding. AI agents oﬀer a path to sustained 
information aggregation, more stable liquidity, and improved calibration, reducing structural biases without altering market fundamentals. Several 
protocols have already begun implementing these ideas, integrating AI-driven forecasting, agent participation, and decisn-support tooling into 
existing market designs. 
In this sense, AI is not an optional enhancement, but a necessary participation layer for prediction markets to mature into durable forecasting 
infrastructure. 
DePIN is the Frontier

Key Themes 
● DePIN networks that vertically integrate, incorporating resources into ﬁnished enterprise/consumer facing products are best positioned to 
generate sustainable revenue and capture higher margins, helping solve the demand side. 
● DePAI data collection protocols are positioned to break out in 2026 as demand for scarce real-world data accelerates, enabled by 
DePIN-style incentives that support faster and more scalable collection than centralized solutions. 
● InfraFi will emerge as a breakout DePIN-adjacent category by connecting onchain capital to net-new, infrastructure niches underserved by 
traditional private credit such as debt ﬁnancing. 
● Regulatory clarity will expand the DePIN builder base and accelerate corporate entry by reducing uncertainty around token design and 
making enterprise-integrated DePIN models more feasible. 
● DePIN could exceed $100 million in onchain veriﬁed revenue in 2026, as established protocols scale from seven to eight ﬁgure annual 
revenues and new blue chip DePINs TGE. 
Introduction 
2025 was deﬁned by steady growth in fundamentals and a few big wins for the DePIN sector 
The year’s developments can be grouped into four core themes: 
● Strong growth in veriﬁed revenue, signaling early product–market ﬁt among leading networks (~$55 million in total annualized revenue). 
● Greater emphasis on transparency, with revenue and usage increasingly veriﬁable onchain. 
● A shift away from total addressable market narratives toward fundamentals, positioning DePIN as one of crypto’s most substantive 
application layers. 
● Continued experimentation across token design, go-to-market strategy, and infrastructure ﬁnancing, laying the groundwork for more 
scalable and sustainable protocols. 
This year marked a sharp contrast with 2024, which was deﬁned by rapid token price appreciation, narrative momentum, and heavy fundraising 
across nearly every DePIN subsector. Excitement was driven by early success stories, most notably Helium Mobile’s growth from zero to over 
100,000 users, as well as DePIN’s overlap with dominant crypto narratives around AI, GPU compute, and data generation. 
That enthusiasm pulled a young sector, one building real-world infrastructure on Web2-like timelines, into crypto-style valuations disconnected 
from present fundamentals. When broader crypto markets weakened in early 2025 following the start of the new U.S. administration, DePIN 
token prices fell sharply and failed to recover, declining roughly 56% year-to-date. 
The decline in token prices grounded DePIN closer to its real progress. Revenue growth continued in 2025 at a pace consistent with companies 
that are, in most cases, less than three years old. 
Nevertheless, DePIN occupied an uncomfortable middle ground for public investors. Narrative-driven traders discounted revenue-backed tokens,

while fundamental investors viewed price-to-sales multiples as still overly inﬂated. No investor segment could fully get behind DePIN or 
champion it. 
Even so, by late 2025 the broader crypto backdrop began to turn more favorable. New L1 and L2 launches underperformed expectations, 
memecoin activity waned, and attention shifted toward assets with real revenue, buybacks, and measurable value accrual. Tokens such as HYPE 
and PUMP, generating among the highest onchain revenues, emerged as the new models for success. Fundamentals, cash ﬂow, and P/S multiples 
moved back to the center of the crypto conversation. 
In this seeming new environment, DePIN is well positioned for the next phase of crypto’s evolution. Its deﬁning characteristics, real-world utility, 
observable demand, and growing revenue, align closely with where the market is headed. The open question is execution: whether DePIN 
networks can continue scaling revenue and mature into large, durable businesses. 
Our 2026 DePIN theses focus on the strategies and subsectors most likely to shape this next phase, from how networks scale revenue and capture 
value to which emerging verticals are positioned to break out. 
Vertical Integration Solves the DePIN Demand Side 
Most DePIN networks produce commoditized resources that struggle to tap into large-scale sustainable demand. 
The most proﬁtable models will be those that tightly integrate their DePIN-derived resources into vertically integrated, end-to-end products 
that go Direct-2-Consumer (D2C). The shift toward verticalization is already underway, with Helium Mobile leading as the number one DePIN 
by revenue ($20.1 million annualized), while upcoming players like Daylight and Fuse quietly build the largest real-world facing businesses in 
crypto, incorporating DePIN into their verticalized stack behind the scenes.

Commodity Resources Obtain Commodity Margins 
Early DePIN networks were built on the belief that they could scale by generating large volumes of raw resources and selling them directly into 
open markets. The assumption was that abundant community supplied hardware would allow these networks to compete primarily on price for 
resources such as GPU compute, bandwidth and storage, while also oﬀering performance advantages like lower latency through more distributed 
edge architectures. 
In practice, generated revenue was lackluster. 
A number of DePINs assumed the problem was a lack of sales and marketing support to sell the raw resources. In response, many protocols 
created gateway companies or foundations that operated as dedicated sales and marketing arms for the network. This approach was eﬀective at 
generating early traction and producing initial revenue in the six to seven ﬁgure range, but it has not translated into greater scale, and most DePINs 
have been unable to grow these eﬀorts into eight ﬁgure revenue and beyond. 
Part of the problem is that selling undiﬀerentiated commoditized resources is inherently a low margin business. Competing in this environment

253 
requires oﬀering the lowest possible price, which forces networks to depend heavily on high sales volume to generate meaningful revenue. 
Commodity resources are: 
● Interchangeable regardless of who provides them. 
● Market competition tends to drive prices toward the cost of production. 
● Supply is abundant, which limits pricing power. 
● Scaling revenue depends heavily on volume rather than premium pricing. 
DePINs have simply not been able to generate enough volume to compensate for low margins. 
The issue is multifaceted but can be distilled into two primary obstacles: 
1. Lack of access to end consumersEnd consumers are willing to pay a premium for integrated, user-facing products, but they have little 
need for raw commoditized resources. Most DePINs never reach this customer segment, which limits their ability to capture higher margin 
revenue. 
2. Limited adoption by businesses that already build integrated productsBusinesses that could theoretically use these resources tend to 
rely on established supply chains or operate with technical and operational setups that are not compatible with resources produced through 
DePIN networks. This reduces the pool of viable enterprise buyers and reinforces the challenge of scaling demand. 
For the most part, selling low-margin raw resources is likely not a winning strategy for DePINs. 
The solution might lie in increasing margins by delivering a vertically integrated product with high margins that can tap into both consumer and 
enterprise markets. 
Vertical Integration Turns DePIN Resources Into Usable Products 
Packaging DePIN derived resources into complete consumer or enterprise facing products increases margins, lowering the relative volume 
required to scale revenues. By launching a full end-to-end product, DePINs can increase proﬁtability and revenue growth, accelerating the DePIN 
ﬂywheel and as a result token value. 
Vertical integration increases value created by DePIN networks: 
● It moves DePINs out of low margin commodity markets and into higher margin integrated products that can command premium pricing. 
● It expands the customer base by enabling direct access to end consumers and enterprises. 
● It creates meaningful diﬀerentiation, reducing the race to the bottom that deﬁnes commoditized resource markets. 
● It strengthens long term token value by tying the network to multiple higher value economic activities instead of a single commodity 
output. 
● It creates tighter feedback loops between users and the network, enabling faster product iteration and alignment with customer demand. 
The winning formula is not to create a resource and hope that demand eventually appears. The winning formula is to build the full product stack

around that resource. We expect that a large share of the most successful and proﬁtable DePIN networks will adopt verticalized product strategies 
going forward. 
Helium Mobile: A Blueprint for Verticalization 
Helium Mobile is the strongest proof point that verticalization works. Instead of selling bandwidth as a generic commodity, Helium Mobile 
delivers a full consumer wireless product by doing the following: 
● Bundling hotspot coverage into a mobile service. 
● Handling onboarding, billing, SIM provisioning, and customer support. 
● Integrating hotspot coverage, coverage maps, and network fallback into one uniﬁed experience. 
● Delivering a consumer-ready mobile oﬀering built on decentralized infrastructure. 
This approach has reshaped Helium’s economics. The network now generates $21 million in annualized revenue, and Helium Mobile accounts for 
53% of HNT and Data Credit burns. The majority of value accrual is therefore driven by a single Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) 
rather than the broader carrier oﬄoad network with partners like AT&T and T-Mobile.

## Page 256

255 
 
The reason is straightforward. Helium Mobile burns 100% of its subscription revenue from its $15 and $30 monthly plans. Even though Helium 
Mobile Oﬄoad burns far less HNT than carrier oﬄoad in a given period, the MVNO generates far more revenue because it sells a higher margin, 
vertically integrated mobile service directly to consumers. In the week of Dec 8, Helium Mobile Oﬄoad burned $6,700 of HNT compared to 
$201,377 from carrier oﬄoad, yet Helium Mobile generated $216,000 that week in subscription revenue that ﬂowed entirely to HNT holders 
through burns. 
This model changes DePIN unit economics. Instead of competing to sell the cheapest bandwidth to enterprise carriers, Helium captures much 
higher margins by selling a complete wireless product to end users. The result is the ﬁrst DePIN with veriﬁable 8-ﬁgure revenue at $21 million 
annualized. It demonstrates that meaningful scale comes not from selling raw bandwidth but from turning decentralized bandwidth into a 
verticalized mobile service. 
Longer term, Helium Mobile may shift to burning a portion of bottom-line proﬁt rather than all top-line revenue for sustainability, but even then 
the verticalized model is likely to remain far more value accretive than commodity sales.

This is the diﬀerence between commodity exposure and full-stack product ownership. 
Other Vertically Integrated Approaches 
Emerging networks across multiple sectors highlight the advantages of verticalization. 
Filecoin 
  Filecoin initially launched as a decentralized network optimized for long-term, cost-eﬃcient (“cold”) storage. Over time, the protocol expanded 
beyond this narrow use case through a series of architectural and ecosystem developments, including tighter IPFS integration, improvements to 
retrieval markets, the introduction of Filecoin Plus and its allocator program to onboard higher-quality and enterprise-grade datasets, and, most 
notably, the launch of the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), which added onchain programmability and application-level coordination. 
 
Together, these changes have moved Filecoin toward a vertically integrated decentralized infrastructure stack, supporting not only storage, but also 
payments, programmability, data access, and service composition. Historically, many teams were reluctant to migrate from centralized cloud 
providers like AWS due to high switching costs, limited service coverage, and poor developer and user experience. While these challenges have

257 
not disappeared entirely, Filecoin’s expanded infrastructure, enterprise integrations, and onchain coordination primitives have materially improved 
the cost–beneﬁt equation for certain Web3, data-intensive, and veriﬁable compute workloads. 
Daylight 
Daylight is a renewable energy company that installs distributed energy resources such as solar panels and batteries. It encourages users to connect 
these assets to the Daylight network through forthcoming token rewards, allowing Daylight to access ﬂexible energy capacity and the associated 
data. 
Energy data and user-granted ﬂexibility are not commodities. A household can only make its energy available to one network or Virtual Power 
Plant (VPP) at a time. The DePIN layer is therefore embedded within a larger technical stack that standardizes energy data and makes ﬂexible 
capacity usable for downstream VPPs and energy markets. 
Daylight is vertically integrated end to end. It sources Distributed Energy Resource (DER) connections, gains access to the energy and data 
through the network, and sells a diﬀerentiated product to energy buyers. 
Fuse 
Fuse operates a broader energy stack than Daylight. It handles energy generation, retail sales, and VPP operations within a single system. Rather 
than selling capacity and data to independent VPPs, Fuse operates its own VPP and uses its ENERGY network to attract supply. 
Traditional VPP incentives often amount to only $4 to $5 per month and must be paid out in cash. Fuse uses token incentives to signiﬁcantly 
increase the amount of ﬂexible capacity it can access while lowering its cost of acquisition. These savings then fund customer discounts and 
rewards within the Fuse energy ecosystem. 
Fuse does not sell its DePIN-derived resource to third parties, yet it still demonstrates the power of vertical integration. The DePIN network 
ampliﬁes the economics of a much larger value stack. 
Conclusion 
The DePIN networks that will endure are not commodity resource sellers. They will be vertically integrated platforms that transform decentralized 
supply into complete products with clear customers, clear distribution, and clear economics. Verticalization shifts how demand is created and 
captured, which raises the next question: which resource categories naturally support full stack integration, and which ones are structurally bound 
to commoditization? 
Regulatory Clarity Opens the Door to Corporate DePINs and Lowers the Barrier to Entry for 
Entrepreneurs 
As the SEC moves toward a clear framework for DePIN token regulation, including no-action letters issued to DoubleZero and Fuse and explicit 
signaling that high-value real-world utility networks will be protected, the regulatory derisking will unlock a wave of non-crypto corporate

participation and dramatically lower barriers for new entrepreneurs entering the DePIN space. 
 
First Steps Towards a Dedicated SEC Framework for DePIN 
The most important shift underway is that the SEC is increasingly recognizing that not all tokens resemble ﬁnancial instruments. 
● They are directly tied to the consumption of real physical services such as bandwidth, compute, storage, mapping, or energy, giving them 
functional utility beyond purely ﬁnancial use. 
● Their primary economic role is to meter, allocate, and settle access to decentralized infrastructure, making real usage a core driver of value 
even when speculation exists. 
● They incentivize deployment and operation of real-world hardware, creating supply-side growth dynamics that traditional crypto tokens 
               
 


---

## Page 260

259 
and securities do not address. 
● They do not provide ownership claims, revenue rights, or contractual proﬁt expectations, distinguishing them from securities even when 
governance or speculative elements are present. 
An SEC framework that explicitly carves out DePIN tokens as non-securities is more than a regulatory nuance. It would represent the ﬁrst major 
structural shift in crypto policy since the Genius Act and brings legal certainty to an area where ambiguity has long constrained institutional 
adoption, capital formation, and entrepreneurial risk-taking. 
No-Action Relief for DoubleZero and Fuse Establishes the First Precedents 
The issuance of no-action letters for DoubleZero and Fuse creates the ﬁrst real-world precedents for compliant DePIN token models. These 
decisions matter for two reasons. 
First, they represent a test case that demonstrates the SEC’s willingness to diﬀerentiate between: tokens designed for utility and physical service 
provision versus tokens that constitute investment vehicles. 
Second, they give founders and investors the ﬁrst signs of a compliance blueprint for launching tokens tied to physical work, micro-payments, 
bandwidth, compute, and other DePIN primitives. 
That alone lowers the cost of capital, derisks token design, and improves founder willingness to build in the United States. 
Corporate Entry Accelerates Once Legal Risk Falls 
Corporate participation accelerates once legal risk falls. A clear DePIN framework opens the door for entry across several categories: 
● Telecom carriers can deploy last-mile bandwidth, oﬄoad traﬃc, and extend coverage through DePIN networks. 
● Utilities and energy companies can integrate rooftop solar, home batteries, EV chargers, and smart-grid nodes as supply into energy 
DePINs for internal or external VPPs. 
● Autonomous vehicle companies can incentivize the contribution of real-time mobility data, mapping updates, and sensor feeds that enhance 
network intelligence. 
● Robotics manufacturers can operate distributed ﬂeets that earn tokens for physical tasks and high-value embodied data collection. 
● Logistics and supply chain operators can connect IoT sensors, telematics devices, and asset trackers to open networks for routing and 
visibility. 
These companies already operate infrastructure at global scale. What they have lacked is a compliant, standardized, and economically aligned way 
to participate in open physical networks. Regulatory clarity provides exactly that. 
Corporations are also uniquely positioned to beneﬁt from verticalization. By integrating a DePIN network into their existing stack, they can 
reduce operating costs, accelerate infrastructure buildout, and improve the performance of their own products and services.

We are already seeing Inversion Capital attempt to acquire an MVNO in Mexico, integrate Helium to lower connectivity costs for subscribers, and 
use that distribution to onboard users into its Inversion L1 chain and DeFi products as the ﬁrst acquisition in a permanent capital vehicle. 
 
It is too early to validate Inversion’s experiment, but the approach may point us towards the future of corporate DePIN adoption. By acquiring 
distribution and embedding DePIN to improve eﬃciency, Inversion highlights how corporations may be already positioned to leverage their 
existing customer access while capturing the performance and cost advantages that DePIN networks provide. 
Altogether enabling corporate DePIN adoption is a step-change in the potential scale of DePIN, shifting the model from crypto-native to 
enterprise-integrated. 
Entrepreneurial Barriers Collapse as DePIN Is “Derisked”

Founders have long been discouraged by regulatory uncertainty. A clear DePIN framework removes the two biggest friction points: 
● The fear that launching a token could trigger enforcement or be deemed illegal. 
● The diﬃculty of designing compliant token economies in the absence of clear standards or precedent. 
Just as crypto has seen an inﬂux of talent into the stablecoin sector following the regulatory clarity provided by the Genius Act for stablecoins , 
similar clarity within DePIN would expand the founder pool and signiﬁcantly increase the number of new DePIN startups entering the market. 
When the gray zone disappears, the sector no longer contends with regulatory risk and instead beneﬁts from regulatory tailwinds. 
DePAI Protocols Break Out as Real-World Data Demand Surges With a Handful of Investable Tokens 
2026 
 
Demand for real-world data is accelerating as physical AI models move toward large-scale training. Because DePAI can uniquely scale the 
collection of high-quality physical data, the small number of credible DePAI networks that launch in 2026 and prove real revenue are likely to see 
outsized demand for their tokens. 
If physical AI ultimately requires data at the digital AI, the ecosystem remains two to four orders of magnitude short. Open and commercial

262 
robotics datasets currently sit in the 10³ to 10⁵ hour range, roughly where language models were in the pre-GPT-3 era. In practical terms, physical 
AI is nearly a decade behind digital AI on raw data scale, which is exactly the gap DePAI is positioned to close. 
By turning globally distributed robots and sensors into crypto-incentivized data collectors, DePAI can scale physical data generation faster than 
any centralized actor. 
Physical AI’s Hard Bottleneck: Real-World Data 
Physical AI models require millions of hours of real-world data to be trained eﬀectively, yet today’s robotics datasets remain in the low-thousands 
of hours, and even the largest commercial collectors like Scale AI only report around 100 thousand hours of usable physical data. This is two to 
four orders of magnitude below what embodied-AI scaling curves suggest is necessary. With compute controlled by giants like NVIDIA and 
models operated by Big Tech incumbents like OpenAI and Google, the greatest opportunity in advancing physical AI development is high-quality, 
diverse, real-world data. 
This is where DePAI holds unique structural advantages. 
DePAI uses DePIN-like incentives to incentivize the deployment of distributed robots and sensors to scale physical data collection faster and more 
broadly than centralized data collection: 
● Scale: Thousands of independent robot and sensor operators deployed across geographies, not a single corporate ﬂeet. 
● Quality: Structured, high-ﬁdelity, veriﬁable data tied to speciﬁc tasks and environments, guaranteed by cryptographic proofs. 
● Diversity: Heterogeneous hardware, climates, scenes, and contexts, the long-tail variation physical AI models require for broad 
generalization. 
The DePAI Stack Is Broad, But Only Data Collection Presents an Immediate Monetization Opportunity 
The DePAI stack has a wide range of layers (Simpliﬁed):

Most of these layers are multiple years away from large-scale enterprise adoption or protocol-level revenue. 
However, one component is economically viable right now – Real-world data collection. 
AI companies are already paying for: 
● Navigation data 
● Video streams 
● 3D maps 
● Sensor logs 
● Telematics 
● Geospatial signals 
● Long-tail environment footage 
DePAI data collection protocols can ﬁll speciﬁc gaps in these areas, creating a short term monetization opportunity.

Data Collection DePINs are Already Generating Millions In Revenue 
Several existing DePINs already generate real revenue from data sales, showing that AI demand is real and immediate: 
● Hivemapper ($2.1 million annualized revenue): Roadside mapping data for navigation and AI training use cases. 
● DIMO ($257,000 annualized revenue): Vehicle telematics data. 
● Geodnet ($5.1 million annualized revenue): RTK and GNSS data. 
● ROVR ($232,000 annualized revenue): Drone imagery and aerial mapping. 
These networks sell directly into industries that overlap with physical AI training: mapping, navigation, geolocation, autonomous driving, 
simulation, and world-model grounding. They are already serving DePAI use cases, just not as purpose-built robotics data engines. 
The next evolution is DePAI networks designed speciﬁcally to capture robotics-grade, embodied-AI training data. 
DePAI Data Collection is the Most Immediate Opportunity 
Three upcoming projects stand out as the ﬁrst purpose-built DePAI data collectors: 
● BitRobot: BitRobot is a crypto-incentivized, decentralized platform for embodied AI research and robotics data built on Solana with a 
subnet-based architecture. It brings together robots, compute, datasets, and human collaborators into modular subnets that generate 
real-world data, models, and benchmarks to accelerate progress in embodied AI. Participants contribute hardware, data, and compute in 
return for rewards, while the network supports a marketplace of valuable resources that others can rent or use to drive AI breakthroughs. 
● PrismaX: PrismaX is a decentralized robotics data and teleoperations platform backed by $11 million in funding, focused on solving the 
data bottleneck in physical AI and robotics. The protocol aggregates high-quality, multimodal interaction and sensor data from robots and 
human-in-the-loop teleoperations to fuel machine learning models that cannot be trained through simulation or text alone. By standardizing 
remote operation and incentivizing data contributors, Prismax aims to create a scalable data ﬂywheel that bridges the gap between current 
robotics capabilities and the needs of next-generation physical AI models. 
● Poseidon is a full-stack data network focused on producing IP-cleared, high-quality long-tail datasets for AI, with explicit consent, 
licensing, and provenance baked in. It targets data bottlenecks in areas like humanoid robotics, autonomous driving edge cases, and 
multimodal pre-training by bridging distributed collection with structured curation and labeling workﬂows. 
These collectors sit directly in front of real demand. If they validate revenue, the market will have almost no alternatives to consider. 
After Data: Processing, Coordination & Spatial Layers 
The coordination layers of DePAI, which involve establishing universal identity and settlement between autonomous agents, will be critical for 
long-term scale, but are not immediate revenue drivers. These teams round out the DePAI ecosystem but will scale adoption later: 
● peaq is an L1 purpose-built for the “machine economy,” focused on helping DePIN apps bring devices, robots, and machines onchain and

## Page 266

265 
monetize real-world activity. It positions itself as the coordination layer plus protocol standards that make machine networks interoperable 
and economically usable. 
● IoTeX is an L1 ecosystem focused on “real-world AI,” aiming to transform data from physical machine networks into collective 
intelligence that can power next-generation AI systems. It’s positioned as an open stack for DePIN-style machine data, identity, and 
coordination for connected devices. 
● Auki is building a “real-world web” that makes physical spaces browsable, navigable, and searchable for AI, centered around its posemesh 
and spatial infrastructure. The network is designed to provide machines and agents with a shared, decentralized understanding of space 
through visual positioning and spatial computing primitives. 
● OpenMind is building OM1, an open-source, AI-native operating system for robots, positioned as an “Android for robots” that helps 
robots perceive, reason, and act across diﬀerent hardware. It pairs OM1 with FABRIC, a decentralized coordination layer for trust and 
collaboration among robots and agents. 
All of these teams are compelling, but none are positioned to generate revenue on a 2026 timeline in the same way that DePAI data collection 
protocols are. 
The Grand Prize: Proprietary Physical AI Models and Operating Systems 
Over time, DePAI protocols may ﬁnd that the greatest source of value is not selling data to third-party robotics companies, but developing 
proprietary physical AI models trained on data they alone can collect. While large-scale robotics data may take years or even decades to fully 
commoditize, demand for raw datasets is likely to decline as models become more capable and data eﬃciency improves. 
For that reason, it may be strategically rational for DePAI networks to begin building their own physical AI models early, using their proprietary 
data advantage rather than relying indeﬁnitely on data sales. This mirrors the broader verticalization trend across DePIN, where moving up the 
stack enables higher margins and more durable businesses. 
The long-term investment case for DePAI is therefore not limited to data collection. It lies in the development of diﬀerentiated physical AI models 
and operating systems built on exclusive, globally distributed physical data. 
The 2026 Catalyst: A Scarcity of TGEs Concentrating Attention in Select Tokens 
Demand for real-world data is accelerating as physical AI moves from research to deployment. At the same time, only a small number of 
purpose-built DePAI data collection networks exist, and most have not yet launched tokens. 
While existing DePIN networks demonstrate that demand for physical infrastructure is real, they are not optimized for robotics or embodied AI 
data. This creates a narrow window where the ﬁrst DePAI data collectors to launch tokens and validate revenue will stand largely alone as 
investable assets in the category.

In an environment where DeFi fees are compressing and speculative narratives are scarce, the launch of revenue-backed DePAI tokens could 
attract outsized attention. If Bitrobot, Prismax, or similar projects demonstrate even modest early revenue, it’s not unreasonable that capital would 
concentrate rapidly into a handful of tokens with extremely limited supply. 
Other projects such as OpenMind, Poseidon, Auki, peaq, and IoTeX may oﬀer broader exposure to the DePAI theme, but their adoption curves are 
likely to extend further into the future. 
Veriﬁed Onchain DePIN Revenue Surpasses $100 Million in 2026 
After a year of separating signal from noise, the DePIN sector now has a clearer understanding of where real, auditable economic value exists. 
While total revenue associated with DePIN activity likely exceeds $150 million annually, only a subset of that ﬁgure is veriﬁable onchain, a 
distinction that has become increasingly important to both investors and token holders. 
According to DePIN Pulse, onchain-veriﬁable DePIN revenue currently sits at roughly $50-$55 million annualized. While lower than commonly 
cited headline ﬁgures, this number represents a growing base of revenue that is transparent, auditable, and increasingly aligned with token 
economics. In practice, 2025 served as the sector’s “revenue validation” year, shifting the focus away from unaudited oﬀchain claims toward 
measurable onchain settlement.

Why Onchain Revenue Became the Benchmark 
Over the past cycle, inﬂated or opaque revenue ﬁgures, driven by oﬀchain settlement, intermediated partnerships, or unclear accounting, made it 
diﬃcult to assess true network traction or value accrual. As concerns with self dealing increased, the DePIN community increasingly converged on 
a simple standard: if revenue cannot be independently veriﬁed, it should not be considered. 
Messari aligns with this stance. Onchain-veriﬁable revenue provides a clean scoreboard for founders to optimize against and a credible metric for 
investors to underwrite growth. This is not a dismissal of oﬀchain revenue, much of it is real, but a recognition that markets cannot eﬃciently 
price what they cannot audit. 
Offchain Revenue Exists, but Attribution Remains Fragile

Several DePIN-adjacent businesses report substantial oﬀchain revenue. Grass indicated mid-eight-ﬁgure annual oﬀchain revenue in early 2025 
(now reporting much lower onchain revenues as of November), while Fuse reportedly generates $300 million in Annual Recurring Revenue 
(ARR) across its broader business. These ﬁgures are directionally important, but diﬃcult to attribute precisely to DePIN activity or to assess in 
terms of tokenholder value capture. In many cases, revenue is settled oﬀchain, bundled with non-DePIN services, or structured in ways that 
obscure its relationship to its native token. 
As a result, the key question is not whether DePIN generates revenue, it does, but whether that revenue is provable and structurally capable of 
ﬂowing onchain. 
Token Volatility Can Obfuscate Fundamentals Growth 
Because most DePINs receive payment for network usage in their native token, token volatility can draw attention away from fundamental growth. 
Protocols like Akash, DoubleZero, and Helium that saw a decline in token price over the year, yet saw strong revenue growth. As a result, the 
general market perception may be tainted by falling prices and revenues growing, creating increasingly attractive entry valuation as P/S ratios 
continue to decline. 
The signiﬁcance of obfuscated revenue growth is a potential breakout moment in 2026 where the market registers that top performing DePIN 
protocols may have even more attractive valuation than most TradFi equity counterparts.

Why Onchain DePIN Revenue Can Exceed $100 Million in 2026 
We expect 2026 to mark a step-change in onchain-veriﬁable DePIN revenue, as the groundwork laid over the past cycle begins to show up in 
reported numbers. The path to scale does not rely on aggressive assumptions and is driven by two primary vectors: 
● New TGEs launching with onchain-native revenue systems:Networks such as DAWN, BitRobot, and Daylight could settle revenue 
collected onchain in a timely manner, expanding the universe of revenue-producing DePIN tokens while improving measurability and 
transparency. 
● Expansion of existing networks:Established networks like Helium, Hivemapper, io.net, and Geodnet have already demonstrated real 
demand and are accelerating in revenue growth. From August 2025 to November 2025 Geodnet has grown from $3.9 million to $5.6 
million annualized, while Hivemapper has grown from $500,000 to $2.2 million annualized. We expect these incumbents to continue their 
growth, leading to a projected 2X in DePIN revenue onchain in 2026. 
Taken together, these dynamics create a credible trajectory for onchain DePIN revenue to grow from a ~$50 million run rate today to $100+

million in 2026, even without assuming outsized growth from any single network. More importantly, this shift moves DePIN toward a standard of 
transparency and incentive alignment that markets can reliably price. 
InfraFi: Financing Net-New Infrastructure via Crypto Rails 
InfraFi will emerge as a breakout use case adjacent to DePIN, capturing demand for real-world, yield-bearing assets enabled by crypto while 
directly accelerating DePIN’s growth through capital formation synergies. 
At its core, InfraFi connects onchain capital to private infrastructure credit opportunities, oﬀering attractive, non-crypto-correlated yields to capital 
suppliers while ﬁlling persistent ﬁnancing gaps for select categories of infrastructure. Rather than funding speculative assets, InfraFi targets 
productive, cash-generating hardware that sits outside the reach of traditional capital markets. 
Why Onchain Private Credit Failed (So Far) 
Onchain private credit has yet to reach product-market ﬁt. Most early attempts have suﬀered from toxic ﬂow and adverse selection, where 
low-quality borrowers access traditional ﬁnancing and onchain pools are left underwriting inferior risk. 
Goldﬁnch is illustrative. Originally designed to use blockchain rails to eﬃciently extend credit to emerging markets, the protocol ultimately 
pivoted toward traditional corporate private credit. Despite the promise of lower costs and global access, underwriting proved insuﬃcient to 
protect investors, and the original thesis weakened. 
What’s Different This Time 
The InfraFi opportunity is not about reﬁnancing existing borrowers. It’s about ﬁnancing net-new assets created by structural shifts in the real 
economy. These assets generate novel ﬁnancing demand that traditional lenders are poorly positioned to initially serve. 
Two infrastructure categories stand out: 
● Compute. 
● Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). 
Both are experiencing explosive demand growth, capital intensity, and fragmentation, conditions that favor new ﬁnancing rails. 
Compute: Financing GPUs as Productive Assets 
On the compute front, USD.AI has emerged as the leading experiment in InfraFi, focusing on GPU ﬁnancing for AI startups.

## Page 272

Traditional private credit funds largely ignore this market. Their mandate favors large, proﬁtable loans, often with $20+ million minimums, 
extended to hyperscalers like CoreWeave that require billions in capital for large-scale data center deployments. Meanwhile, debt ﬁnancing is 
mostly unavailable for most AI startups. 
USD.AI targets this gap by ﬁnancing mid six-ﬁgure GPU purchases for startups that do not meet traditional thresholds. For these companies, debt 
ﬁnancing is often materially cheaper than equity ﬁnancing, particularly when compute costs can consume up to 80% of total expenditures. 
Financing GPUs with debt can therefore enable greater scale by lowering cost per unit of compute. 
Underwriting and Risk Mitigation 
The InfraFi thesis ultimately hinges on underwriting. Infrastructure credit fails when lenders cannot prevent fraud, misuse, or adverse selection, 
especially when the best borrowers have alternatives. 
               
 


---

## Page 273

272 
USD.AI attempts to address this through a combination of primitives and frameworks, including CALIBER, QEV, and FiLo. Most notable is its 
liquidation and custody model: 
● Borrowers never take physical possession of GPUs. 
● Hardware is delivered directly to a third-party data center and hosted on-site. 
● Borrowers gain usage rights, but no ownership or custody until the end of a three-year repayment term. 
In the event of default, USD.AI does not pursue legal claims. Instead, it repossesses the GPU in place and re-lends it to a new borrower without 
physical relocation. This transforms GPUs into reusable, income-generating assets that can be cycled through multiple credit relationships. 
Whether USD.AI can scale this model while maintaining underwriting discipline remains an open question. But the framework represents an 
intriguing evolution from prior onchain credit experiments. 
Energy: Financing Yield-Bearing DERs 
A parallel model is emerging in energy. Daylight’s DayFi applies similar InfraFi mechanics to ﬁnance yield-bearing electricity assets such as solar 
panels. These assets share many characteristics with compute: high upfront capex, predictable cash ﬂows, and growing demand driven by 
structural trends (powering generative AI, transition to clean energy, growing EV adoption). 
               
 


---

## Page 274

273 
 
An especially compelling frontier lies at the intersection of energy and compute, where power availability increasingly constrains AI deployment. 
As these two inputs become more tightly coupled, demand may emerge not only for ﬁnancing but also for derivative markets that hedge exposure 
to both electricity and compute pricing. 
Beyond Compute and Energy 
While compute and DERs are the clearest early candidates, InfraFi’s potential extends further. Within DePIN, telecom infrastructure, such as 
Helium hotspots or DAWN radio antenna systems, could beneﬁt from similar ﬁnancing models. 
Beyond DePIN, the design space expands further: satellites, EV ﬂeets, drone swarms, tourist rockets, and other capital-intensive systems where 
net-new assets generate cash ﬂows but fall outside traditional underwriting frameworks.

Bottom Line 
The InfraFi thesis is simple: 
Bootstrapping ﬁnancing for net-new, productive assets is faster and less costly onchain than building new ﬁnancial infrastructure from 
scratch. 
If crypto can reduce administrative friction, tap pre-built global capital pools, and improve capital market eﬃciency, InfraFi may prove to be one 
of the most durable real-world use cases adjacent to DePIN. 
The open question is not whether the demand exists for ﬁnancing, but whether crypto-native capital markets reduce costs and prove more eﬃcient 
compared to incumbents. 
Compute Derivative Markets Will Emerge Onchain First 
Building on the broader thesis that net-new assets and ﬁnancial use cases deploy more eﬃciently on crypto rails, compute derivatives stand out as 
one of the most compelling and underexplored opportunities. As compute become a core economic input for AI, cloud services, and digital 
infrastructure, there is still no mature global market for hedging compute price or availability risk. This gap creates a natural opening for 
crypto-native markets to lead.

Compute as a Net-New Financial Asset 
Compute, particularly GPU compute, is eﬀectively a new commodity. Unlike commodities such as oil or electricity, compute markets are 
fragmented, opaque, and subject to rapid technological change. Prices vary materially by chip type (e.g., H100 vs. A100), geography, contract 
duration, and availability. Supply chains are constrained, capex cycles are long, and demand is increasingly volatile. 
As a result, multiple market participants face signiﬁcant, unhedged risk: 
● Data center operators may want to lock in today’s price per GPU-hour to protect against future price declines as new supply comes online. 
● AI startups and enterprises may want to hedge against upward price pressure or shortages by ﬁxing long-term compute costs. 
● Traders and speculators may seek exposure to compute as a macro input into the AI economy. 
These dynamics mirror the early conditions that gave rise to energy and commodity derivatives, yet compute lacks the legacy market infrastructure

those assets beneﬁted from. 
Why Crypto Rails Are Better 
Crypto rails are uniquely well-suited to incubate compute derivative markets: 
● Liquidity is already present. Onchain perp and derivatives venues can bootstrap markets far faster than regulated, centralized counterparts. 
● Permissionless participation allows global data centers, startups, and traders to interact without bespoke legal or brokerage relationships. 
● Composability enables compute derivatives to plug directly into InfraFi, structured products, DePIN networks, and the broader crypto 
ecosystem. 
● New contract types (price, availability, utilization, chip-speciﬁc indices) can be launched with lower friction. 
By contrast, centralized markets face long lead times for regulatory approval, index construction, clearing infrastructure, and participant 
onboarding. By the time these markets form, crypto-native venues may already have established liquidity and pricing power. 
Beyond Price: Hedging Availability Risk 
Importantly, compute derivatives are not limited to price hedging. Availability risk may prove even more critical. For example, an AI company 
launching a new model may require guaranteed access to a ﬁxed number of H100 GPU-hours during a speciﬁc future window. A derivative 
contract tied to delivery or availability, rather than just spot price, could allow that ﬁrm to hedge execution risk, while compute suppliers monetize 
future capacity. 
These primitives blur the line between ﬁnancial derivatives and infrastructure markets, reinforcing synergies with DePIN and InfraFi. 
Early Players 
While still nascent, early data points suggest momentum: 
● Squaretower launched compute-linked perpetuals on Injective’s Helix in August, generating over $20 million in cumulative volume to date. 
● Ornn, which originated as a Web2 compute price index and marketplace, is signaling entry in Web3 infrastructure and has raised $5.8 
million, signaling growing investor interest in standardized compute pricing. 
● Global Compute Index’s also oﬀer compute perps based on compute price indices aggregated from a range of data sources. 
The most critical missing primitive remains a credible, manipulation-resistant compute price index. Without a trusted base truth for GPU pricing 
and availability, derivative markets struggle to scale. However, the incentives to build such indices increase rapidly should speculative and hedging 
demand materializes. 
Structural Tailwinds Into 2026 
               
 


---

## Page 278

277 
We believe compute derivatives are early but approaching an inﬂection point, with several powerful tailwinds: 
● Explosive demand growth: An estimated $5.2T in compute related capex is projected to be required by 2030. 
● Compute as a macro input: AI makes compute costs strategically important across industries. 
● Crypto-native speed: Permissionless capital and global liquidity dramatically compress time-to-market. 
● Deep synergies with DePIN and InfraFi: Financialization of infrastructure is a natural next step. 
Taken together, these factors suggest that compute derivatives are more likely to break out onchain ﬁrst, with crypto markets establishing a durable 
lead before centralized infrastructure can respond. If successful, this could represent one of the largest new ﬁnancial markets to emerge from 
crypto over the next cycle. 
The Time for Consumer Crypto is Now 
Authors: AJC and Austin Weiler 
Key Themes 
● The fee stack has ﬂipped from chains to apps. With blockspace no longer the bottleneck, consumer crypto is evolving into an 
application-led economy, where apps capture the majority of revenue and can ﬁnally optimize for user experience. 
● Consumer PMF is clearest where markets are the product. Memecoins/NFTs and prediction markets work because they embed ownership 
and pricing directly into cultural behavior and information-seeking, rather than bolting crypto onto existing apps. 
● Prediction markets graduated beyond elections into sustained usage. 2025 validated non-political demand (sports/crypto/culture), with 
distribution partnerships (e.g., Robinhood) acting as the major accelerant. 
● Financialized social is still in its early stages, but the design space is real. The opportunity isn’t decentralizing social; it’s making content, 
creators, and interactions tradable in a way that creates a net-new user experience. 
● Exotic RWAs are an emerging consumer wedge. Tokenization is starting to improve non-ﬁnancial goods markets (trading cards/gacha), 
with credible paths toward onchain liquidity, provenance, and composable ﬁnancial layers for collectibles. 
Introduction 
For years, large parts of the industry have approached consumer crypto from a philosophical standpoint. In the early days, perhaps that made 
sense. Bitcoin proved you could win by decentralizing money, so it wasn’t crazy to think you could win again by decentralizing Facebook, Uber, 
or Spotify. But with the beneﬁt of hindsight, it’s fair to say that this approach has largely been invalidated. Decentralization, censorship resistance, 
and self-sovereignty are important ideals, but the uncomfortable truth is that the average consumer simply does not care about them. No one is

leaving their favorite apps, starting from zero, and rebuilding their digital life just because the backend is “onchain.” 
What is hard to acknowledge, even for those of us who care about cypherpunk ideals, is that these principles aren’t what will unlock mainstream 
consumer adoption. And yet, from a purely practical standpoint, there has never been a better time to build consumer applications in crypto. 
 
In past cycles, high transaction costs made building an onchain consumer application an uphill battle. Blockchains captured the majority of fees, 
and every dollar that users spent on gas was, in essence, a tax on the consumer experience. 
However, over the past ﬁve years, onchain infrastructure has scaled greatly. Blockspace is no longer a bottleneck or a prohibitive cost. As a result, 
the fee landscape has undergone a dramatic shift. In 2021, blockchains made $13.51 billion in fees, accounting for 64% of all onchain revenue. In 
2025, blockchains generated just $2.43 billion, accounting for only 17% of onchain fees. Applications, not blockchains, now drive the majority of 
onchain revenue, a trend we expect to continue accelerating. 
Consumer crypto encompasses a wide range of applications, including memecoins, social networks, wallets, gaming, and more. And while it’s 
impossible to cover every subsector in depth, this year’s Theses will focus on the areas that have already found real product-market ﬁt, along with

the areas we believe are positioned to ﬁnd it next year and in the years ahead. 
Where Product-Market Fit is Today 
Memecoins and NFTs 
Consumer crypto’s oldest, and perhaps most well-known, products are NFTs and memecoins. While often dismissed as speculative distractions 
from “serious” use cases, these assets are some of the clearest examples of product-market ﬁt in crypto to date. They tap directly into cultural 
demand that already exists in the real world and bring it onchain through assets that users actively buy, trade, and rally around. 
 
The demand is undeniably cyclical, but when it materializes, it does so at a meaningful scale. In 2022, NFT and memecoin applications generated 
$2.11 billion in onchain fees, accounting for nearly 19% of all onchain fees. This cycle, we saw a similar trend, albeit at a slightly smaller scale. 
These applications generated $892.9 million in fees in 2024 (6% of total onchain fees) and $1.29 billion in 2025, representing 9% of all onchain

fees. Importantly, these ﬁgures only capture fees directly attributable to NFT and memecoin applications, and exclude fees paid to blockchains and 
intermediary venues, such as DEXs. In practice, the total onchain economic activity driven by NFTs and memecoins is signiﬁcantly higher. 
Memecoins and NFTs are probably the clearest expression of crypto’s cultural value. In the real world, we already assign a premium to select 
assets with no fundamental cash ﬂows, such as jewelry, watches, art, sneakers, Funko Pops, and even plush toys like Labubu. None of these 
produces income or solves a hard economic problem, but they have cultural value through status, identity, nostalgia, and taste. 
Memecoins and NFTs fall into the same category. They might not have discounted cash ﬂows or clear utility, but that doesn’t mean they’re 
worthless. Their value comes from shared narratives, in-jokes, communities, and online identity. Some memecoins ﬁt this framing far better than 
others. Tokens like SPX and MOG, which have spawned persistent, cult-like communities, align neatly with this idea. In contrast, memecoins tied 
to one-oﬀ viral moments, like PWEASE, do not. For the remainder of this section, we refer to memecoins in the former category. 
In this sense, memecoins and NFTs serve a surprisingly important role, as they demonstrate how society assigns cultural value to crypto. When 
these assets trend down only, it functions as a canary in the coal mine, signaling that the foundational ideas that shaped crypto may not be 
resonating as strongly as they once did. Unfortunately, the cultural value of crypto appears to be lower now than at any point in recent memory.

NFTs are now entering their fourth year of a bear market, following a peak in late 2021 and early 2022. The total market cap of NFTs has 
decreased by 63% in 2025 alone, currently standing at $3.00 billion. The decline is more pronounced when examining individual collections. 
Milady, which even received public support from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin earlier this year, is down 75%, with its market cap now at 
$34.8 million. The only slight bright spot has been CryptoPunks, which are down a comparatively modest 28%, propped up in part by 
PunkStrategy, a protocol that algorithmically buys and sells Punks using trading fees.

## Page 283

282 
 
Memecoins have not fared any better. The memecoin euphoria of 2024 has come to an end, and prices have collapsed across the board. The total 
memecoin market cap is down 59% in 2025, currently standing at $39.06 billion (BTC is down 3% over the same period). WIF, the token that 
arguably kicked oﬀ the “Memecoin Supercycle,” is among the hardest hit, down 80% this year. Even one of the few memecoins that broke into the 
spotlight in 2025, FARTCOIN, is down 66% on the year. 
The simplest explanation for the collapse in memecoins is that the game got ﬁgured out, leading to a classic speculative bust. And yes, that 
dynamic played a role. But rather than eulogizing the category, it’s more constructive to ask how memecoins and NFTs can be improved. Both 
have tapped into real cultural demand in the past, so the challenge now is ﬁguring out how to reignite it.

The ﬁrst key insight for this sector is that memecoins and NFTs are two sides of the same coin; both are expressions of crypto’s cultural value. As 
a result, they largely compete for the same pool of capital and attention. Up until early 2024, capital was split roughly 50/50 between memecoins 
(excluding DOGE) and NFTs. However, once memecoins truly took oﬀ in Q1'24, the balance shifted dramatically, and the split has hovered closer 
to 80/20 ever since.

## Page 285

Ultimately, memecoins and NFTs competing against each other end up hurting both. They draw liquidity, attention, and buyers away from one 
another instead of reinforcing the same ecosystem. The clearest example of this came from the wave of NFT collections that launched their own 
tokens at the end of last year: Milady & CULT, Pudgy Penguins & PENGU, and Azuki & ANIME. 
The outcome of their token launches, for lack of a better word, was brutal. Not only did the tokens fail to retain their value, but the underlying 
NFTs also experienced a signiﬁcant decline in value. From their respective token launches: 
● Milady: -86% 
● CULT: -96% 
● Pudgy Penguins: -87% 
● PENGU: -61% 
● Azuki: -92% 
● ANIME: -93% 
Instead of creating new demand, these token launches siphoned liquidity out of their own ecosystems, weakening both the NFT and token sides of

the brand. 
The ﬁrst step toward recovery in crypto’s cultural sector is addressing the structural divide between memecoins and NFTs. Right now, they 
fracture the very demand they’re supposed to capture. Take a user who wants exposure to Remilia. What are they supposed to buy? A Milady? 
CULT? A secondary collection like Redacted Remilio Babies? 
Even if they pick one, there’s no guarantee they’re actually getting exposure to the Remilia community in the way they intend. Buying CULT 
doesn’t lift Milady prices, and buying a Milady doesn’t aﬀect CULT. The ecosystem is split across multiple assets that don’t reinforce each other. 
If Remilia becomes culturally relevant, but that relevance is only reﬂected in the token, Milady holders miss out on the upside. If it appears only in 
the NFT, CULT holders miss out on the upside. 
The reverse dynamic has also played out. Once a memecoin gains real cultural traction, an accompanying NFT drop is almost guaranteed, diluting 
attention and liquidity yet again. 
 
The core problem with today’s cultural assets is simple. NFTs and memecoins split exposure. Communities want one thing to rally around, but

## Page 287

286 
instead they’re forced into a menu of disconnected assets: an NFT, a token, a secondary collection, a derivative drop, none of which reinforce each 
other. ERC-404 is a potential solution to this problem. 
ERC-404 is a hybrid token standard that merges the liquidity of fungible tokens with the uniqueness of NFTs. By doing so, it directly addresses 
the issue of fragmentation. Instead of issuing a separate token and hoping it doesn’t cannibalize the NFT, ERC-404 ties the two together in a 
single asset. Fractional amounts trade like a token on AMMs (giving you liquidity), but holding one full unit corresponds to an NFT (giving you 
cultural expression, identity, and status). 
For example, using ERC-404, a Remilia-style ecosystem wouldn’t need separate assets for CULT, Milady, and Remilio Babies. Instead, there 
would be one uniﬁed asset. If the brand becomes culturally relevant, both the liquid token and the NFT expression capture that value 
simultaneously, because they are the same asset. In an ERC-404 model, you don’t get dilution across multiple assets, you don’t get narratives 
pulling in diﬀerent directions, and you don’t have to guess which instrument will actually capture the upside. By unifying liquidity and cultural 
expression into a single asset, ERC-20 resolves the tension between memecoins and NFTs rather than attempting to balance them through separate 
instruments. 
ERC-404 may be able to address the market structure of NFTs and memecoins, but it will not resolve the deeper issue plaguing these assets: their 
lack of cultural appeal. In retrospect, the launch of TRUMP and the vampire attack by MELANIA just days later severely damaged the credibility 
of crypto’s culture. The TRUMP memecoin was already pushing the limits, but the MELANIA launch exposed what the memecoin sector had 
eﬀectively become: a cash-grab opportunity. Kerosene was then thrown onto an already burning ﬂame with the subsequent launches of LIBRA, 
YZY, and countless other memecoins that served no purpose beyond extracting money for their creators. 
At this point, it is hard to argue that the cultural value of this asset sector is not completely in the gutter. If you disagree, try to ﬁnd a memecoin or 
NFT with a market cap above $1 million that is also up year-over-year (Good luck!). The road to recovery will be long, and we’re not exactly 
hopeful it will happen in 2026, but, a recovery will happen… eventually. 
That recovery will not be driven by fundamentals, utility, or technological breakthroughs. It will happen because memecoins and NFTs remain the 
most eﬀective vehicles for expressing shared, collective belief in the social value of an asset. As long as humans continue to speculate on cultural 
meaning, a practice they have engaged in for centuries, the appetite to assign and trade social value will not disappear. When that speculative 
impulse inevitably returns onchain, it will once again ﬂow into memecoins and NFTs. The hope is that, when it does, the market is built on more 
resilient structures, potentially through standards like ERC-404, rather than the extractive models that deﬁned the most recent cycle. 
Prediction Markets 
Prediction markets broke into the mainstream during the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election as Polymarket and Kalshi odds appeared alongside 
traditional polling. Their markets were viewed as an alternative barometer of electoral sentiment and ultimately proved more eﬀective in 
predicting the eventual election outcome than conventional polls.

In the ﬁve months leading up to the election, Polymarket and Kalshi volume grew 3,186% from $140.0 million in May 2024 to $4.6 billion in 
October 2024, the peak month before the November 5 election. This surge made prediction markets one of the ﬁrst breakout applications in 
crypto. 
However, political markets accounted for 62% of prediction market volume in 2024, leading many to view politics as the only real use case and 
question whether demand could persist beyond U.S. election cycles. 
Initially, skeptics were proven right as monthly volume fell 63% over the four months following the election, from $4.6 billion in October 2024 to 
$1.7 billion in February 2025. 
However, during the rest of 2025, prediction markets resoundingly proved they have clear PMF beyond political markets. 
After the February low, monthly volume on Polymarket and Kalshi increased 441% to $9.2 billion in November, with September, October, and 
November 2025 all surpassing the previous October 2024 highs. 
This acceleration stemmed from non-political markets, including sports, crypto, and culture. From July to December 2024, non-political markets

accounted for 38% ($6.0 billion) of the volume on Polymarket and Kalshi. From January to November 2025, non-political markets accounted for 
80% ($31.1 billion) of the volume across the two platforms. Prediction markets expanded signiﬁcantly beyond election-driven demand to achieve 
sustained, non-political usage. 
 
In 2025, the sports sector drove the majority of growth in prediction market volumes. From January to November, the sports sector led volume 
with a 58% share ($23.1 billion). Over the same period, the political sector ranked second with a 20% share ($7.8 billion), followed by the crypto 
sector in third with an 11% share ($4.5 billion), and the culture sector in fourth with a 3% share ($1.2 billion). 
The catalyst that propelled the sports sector forward was Kalshi’s partnership with Robinhood on August 19, which enabled users to trade NFL 
and college football markets through the Robinhood Prediction Markets Hub. The partnership had a twofold impact. First, the platform reduced 
friction for non-crypto-native users by enabling them to trade through their existing Robinhood accounts. Second, it provided U.S. users a 
regulated path to trade sports outcomes with better odds than traditional sportsbooks like DraftKings and FanDuel. Following the partnership, the

monthly sports sector volume increased by 551% from $965.2 million in August to $6.3 billion in November. 
Despite strong momentum in 2025, volumes on prediction markets still only account for a small portion of the broader sports betting landscape. In 
2024, U.S.-licensed sportsbooks processed $150 billion in betting volume, with FanDuel handling $50.7 billion and DraftKings handling $49.4 
billion. 
One factor that largely explains why prediction markets still trail traditional sportsbooks in sports betting volume is the limited wager types, 
speciﬁcally parlay bets and player props. Polymarket does not support parlays, while Kalshi oﬀers limited parlay functionality. Additionally, both 
platforms provide minimal player props. That limitation matters because parlays account for an estimated 30% of traditional sportsbook volume, 
driven by their higher implied payouts and appeal to retail bettors. Without robust parlay and prop oﬀerings, prediction markets leave a 
meaningful portion of sports betting demand unaddressed. 
We believe expanding beyond straight bets represents a clear opportunity to close that gap and should be a focus for prediction markets in 2026. 
Even with those constraints, prediction markets compete where it matters most: pricing. Their orderbook-based structure allows users to trade 
against each other, rather than the “house,” resulting in tighter odds and higher expected payouts for the same outcome. That advantage 
compounds for whales, who place large wagers, where small improvements in odds signiﬁcantly aﬀect their returns. In 2026, we expect this 
pricing edge to continue drawing users away from traditional sportsbooks, particularly larger bettors, and drive further growth in prediction market 
sports volume. 
While sports dominated volume, culture became the fastest-growing prediction market sector in the latter half of 2025. From August to November, 
monthly culture volume grew 625% from $43.6 million to $316.1 million. The increase stemmed from sustained activity across many cultural 
markets, rather than a single headline event. 
Culture markets matter for two reasons. First, the sector posted the second-highest volume-to-open-interest ratio across sectors, trailing only the 
sports sector, which signals high turnover and frequent resolution. That behavior favors platforms that monetize transaction volume, since users 
recycle capital rather than locking it in long-dated bets. 
Second, culture markets have no real alternatives. Sports markets compete with sportsbooks, but no equivalent venue exists for trading outcomes 
tied to internet culture, entertainment, or public social sentiment (i.e., What will be the top Netﬂix show this week?). Prediction markets are the 
only place where users can both create and trade on these outcomes. This mirrors political prediction markets in 2024, where the absence of 
viable alternatives concentrated activity and drove rapid volume expansion. 
That structural advantage gives culture markets a clear path to sustained adoption as prediction markets expand beyond their early user base. 
Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour has said that culture markets have the most growth potential of any prediction market sector over the next ﬁve years. 
As prediction markets permeate non-crypto-native audiences, they will naturally reach users with cultural expertise. Once those users recognize 
that prediction markets let them trade on that knowledge, they will gravitate to the only venue where it is monetizable. Together, these factors 
position culture to rank among the top three fastest-growing prediction market sectors by volume in 2026.

In 2025, prediction market open interest (OI) was a two-horse race between Polymarket and Kalshi, which together accounted for a 91% ($627.7 
million) share of the market. From June 1 to November 30, Kalshi OI grew 258% from $93.7 million to $335.3 million. Over the same period, 
Polymarket OI grew 133% from $125.3 million to $292.4 million. The gap between the two remained narrow throughout the year, but both 
platforms pulled meaningfully ahead of smaller competitors. 
That OI expansion coincided with a year of aggressive ecosystem building. In 2025, both platforms expanded distribution through partnerships 
with major brands, including CNN, CNBC, UFC, NHL, and Yahoo Finance, which are expected to increase mainstream exposure. At the same 
time, both companies raised signiﬁcant capital. Polymarket raised three rounds during the year, capped on October 7 by a $2 billion investment 
from ICE, the parent company of the NYSE, valuing the company at $9 billion. Kalshi raised two rounds, led by a $1 billion undisclosed funding 
round on November 19, which valued the company at $11 billion. 
Taken together, rising OI, expanded distribution, and fresh capital in 2025 position both Polymarket and Kalshi to sustain their current pace of 
growth into 2026, even before factoring in additional product launches or incentive programs.

In the second half of 2025, Polymarket worked toward the launch of its U.S. app, which went live on December 3 for waitlisted users. The public 
rollout represents a major distribution unlock that we expect to materially increase Polymarket’s OI and volume in 2026. Kalshi’s OI and volume 
rose sharply after its partnership with Robinhood in August, which expanded access to non-crypto-native users. If Polymarket’s U.S. app follows a 
similar adoption curve once broadly available, we expect it to result in a signiﬁcant increase in both OI and volume. 
A second catalyst that sits alongside distribution is a potential airdrop. On October 24, Polymarket CMO Matthew Modabber conﬁrmed plans for 
a POLY token and a future airdrop. Although the timing remains unconﬁrmed, market expectations suggest a 2026 launch. Combined with a fully 
available U.S. app, the airdrop introduces an additional incentive mechanism that Kalshi does not currently match. If both catalysts materialize in 
2026, Polymarket’s OI growth will accelerate ahead of Kalshi and pull away from its closest competitor. 
For most of 2025, no prediction market platform outside of Polymarket and Kalshi made meaningful progress on OI until Opinion entered the 
picture. Opinion launched its prediction market, Opinion.Trade, on October 24, on BNB Chain and reached $63.2 million in OI. Prior to Opinion’s 
launch, no other prediction market platform beyond Polymarket and Kalshi had surpassed $3 million in OI, which made Opinion’s early traction 
stand out. 
Opinion did not mirror existing platforms as it launched the ﬁrst prediction market native to BNB Chain, and with a diﬀerentiated product, 
Opinion AI. Opinion AI is a market-creation tool that turns simple prompts into fully speciﬁed Yes/No markets with clear resolution rules, 
allowing users to create markets faster than on competing platforms. In terms of OI and volume, Opinion has already distinguished itself from 
long-tail crypto-native competitors, such as Limitless and Myriad. By combining a diﬀerentiated market-creation product with access to the BNB 
Chain user base, Opinion carved out a credible path to third place by the end of 2025. In 2026, we believe it can be one of the best-performing 
crypto-native alternatives to Polymarket and Kalshi. 
Competition will also intensify from incumbent sportsbooks outside the crypto sector. In 2026, both DraftKings and FanDuel are expected to 
expand into prediction markets, primarily to reach users in states where traditional sports betting remains illegal, such as California and Texas, and 
to oﬀer non-sports markets, including political and macroeconomic outcomes. DraftKings plans to launch DraftKings Predictions in Q1 2026 
following its acquisition of Railbird, a CFTC-licensed exchange. FanDuel has discussed a similar strategy, positioning prediction markets as 
complementary to its sportsbook by enabling trading on events such as elections and oil prices. 
In these macro and non-sports categories, incumbents hold a clear distribution advantage, and we expect them to take market share in 2026, 
speciﬁcally in markets their users previously could not access. DraftKings and FanDuel already dominate sports betting volume, so launching 
prediction markets is unlikely to signiﬁcantly expand their share within sports. The impact is more meaningful in non-sports markets, where 
crypto-native prediction markets previously beneﬁted from being the only venues oﬀering easily accessible markets such as FOMC rate decisions. 
As sportsbooks launch comparable prediction markets, that exclusivity evaporates for the largest and most liquid non-sports markets. However, we 
believe crypto-native prediction markets will retain an advantage in market diversity and long-tail coverage, which will preserve their activity even 
as incumbents compete for headline markets.

Ultimately, despite increased competition from both crypto-native prediction markets and emerging challengers from incumbent sportsbooks, we 
believe Polymarket and Kalshi will remain the clear leaders in the prediction market space. Polymarket could pull ahead of Kalshi if it 
successfully executes a public U.S. app launch, token launch, and potential airdrop. Regardless, both platforms possess the brand recognition and 
capital resources to remain the leading players in prediction markets for the foreseeable future. 
Future PMF through Markets 
We believe the most compelling value proposition of consumer crypto is its ability to embed markets directly into consumer experiences. Rather 
than treating pricing and ownership as abstract or hidden layers, crypto makes them native to the product itself. In practice, this occurs in two 
ways: 
1. Creating markets where none previously existed. 
2. Improving markets in existing consumer experiences that are currently burdened by friction. 
Many of the clearest examples of product-market ﬁt in consumer crypto already follow this pattern. Memecoins and NFTs embed markets into 
internet communities, allowing collective attention and identity to be expressed through price. Prediction markets apply the same logic, replacing 
polls and pundits with tradable probabilities. In each case, markets are not an accessory to the product; they are the product. 
This framework extends naturally beyond crypto-native assets. Consumer crypto can make implicit value explicit by pricing things that were 
previously unpriced, and it can take existing markets and rebuild them onchain in ways that reduce friction, improve transparency, and expand 
what users can do. Where consumer behavior already exists, crypto’s advantage is oﬀering a better way to interact with it. 
The white whale of consumer crypto has always been social media. The dominant platforms (Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, etc.) demonstrate that 
social networks occupy the top of the value stack in consumer tech. If a social platform built on crypto rails actually works at scale, the upside is 
measured in hundreds of billions, not millions. 
Because of that opportunity, there have been repeated attempts over the years to build “crypto’s social platform.” Some have caught lightning in a 
bottle (BitClout in 2021, Friend.tech in 2023, Farcaster in 2024), but none have achieved lasting traction. As a result, social has become one of the 
most polarizing sectors in crypto. While the opportunity is clear, many argue that the network eﬀects established by incumbents have created truly 
impenetrable moats. 
In past Theses, we’ve talked about DeSoc from a philosophical standpoint, such as how social media needs to be decentralized to protect users 
from censorship. This year, we’re taking a more practical approach and retiring the DeSoc term entirely. For a crypto-based social platform to 
succeed, it needs to oﬀer a net-new experience for users, not just replace the backend infrastructure with crypto primitives. And this isn’t just our 
view, Farcaster’s Dan Romero said outright in “State of Farcaster, December 2025,” that decentralization hasn’t delivered PMF.

Zooming out, we still believe there’s a real opportunity for a crypto social platform to succeed. The amount of time society spends online 
continues to increase, and so does the number of platforms people use. In 2010, only ﬁve social platforms had more than 100 million monthly 
active users. By 2015, that number had grown to 19, and by 2025, it reached 34. A crypto social platform doesn’t need to replace an existing social 
primitive; it just needs to be additive to a consumer’s expanding set of online behaviors. 
A crypto social media platform’s greatest strength will be its ability to fully ﬁnancialize the social experience. Traditional platforms have already 
been inching in this direction to support the massive creator economy, which is expected to reach $480 billion by 2027. X creator payouts, 
YouTube revenue sharing, and TikTok’s branded-content marketplace are all ways for social platforms to plug into creator monetization. 
Furthermore, the creator economy exists because online content has real value. For 99.99% of posts, that value rounds down to zero, but in 
aggregate, the stream of content created every day is enormously valuable, hence the half-trillion-dollar creator economy. The problem is that this 
value is largely hidden. Each post has a price, but traditional platforms keep that price hidden from both creators and users. 
Herein lies the edge for ﬁnancialized social media. Not only can crypto move creator payouts onchain, but it can make the value of content public 
by turning posts, creators, and interactions into open markets. Creating markets around social content is the zero-to-one moment for crypto social

platforms. 
All of this brings us to the projects that are actually making progress in this direction. In 2025, the two clear frontrunners are pump.fun and Zora. 
Pump.fun 
Pump.fun has long dominated the launchpad space, and it’s now trying to leverage that position to expand into a full-ﬂedged social platform. 
When the team announced their token earlier this year, they made their ambition explicit: “Kill Facebook, TikTok, and Twitch. On Solana.” 
At ﬁrst, pump.fun’s go-to-market strategy centered heavily on streaming. They claim that their creator-earnings model, Project Ascend, oﬀers 
streamers a far more compelling way to monetize than traditional platforms by allowing them to earn directly from trading fees. Combine that 
with pump.fun’s degenerate user base, which is always ready to speculate on almost anything, and you have the ingredients for a strong 
onboarding funnel for streamers. 
 
Initially, this strategy proved successful for pump.fun. On September 14, Bagwork, an upstart streaming duo, captured attention across crypto and 
mainstream media with a mix of outrageous stunts, including streaking at football games, getting tattoos at market cap milestones, and leaking

unreleased music from rapper Drake. Their streams generated massive attention and netted them $289,400 in creator fees. The virality of 
Bagwork, along with the amount of money they made streaming, catalyzed a surge in streamers on pump.fun. In the week leading up to 
September 14, pump.fun averaged around 9,000 creators claiming fees. In the following week, pump.fun averaged 15,500. 
However, this surge in streaming on pump.fun was short-lived. In November, only an average of 6,700 creators claimed fees, and almost none of 
these creators were streamers. As of writing, there are 157 streamers live on pump.fun. Comparatively, there are 121,900 streamers live on Twitch, 
33,800 on YouTube, and 13,300 on Kick. 
With streaming growth stalling out, pump.fun has started shifting its focus elsewhere. On October 31, the team announced Spotlight, a new 
initiative aimed at accelerating Internet Capital Markets (ICM) on pump.fun. 
Zora 
The other major competitor in the social space is Zora. Earlier this year, Zora completely overhauled its protocol, abandoning its L2 and legacy 
NFT products in favor of moving to Base and fully embracing tokenization. On Zora, every account and every post becomes a token, meaning that 
every piece of content is tradable by default. This creates a fundamentally diﬀerent social experience where the user’s feed doubles as a curated 
list of markets.Through this model, Zora unlocks two key net new user experiences. First, every single piece of content a creator publishes 
becomes a monetization opportunity, since they earn a share of trading fees whenever someone buys their post. Although many platforms already 
help creators earn money, Zora improves upon existing models by turning every post into a potential revenue stream, not just long-form videos or 
sponsorship deals. 
Second, instead of being passive likers, viewers, or retweeters, users can actually take a position on the content they think will take oﬀ. If a post 
goes viral, early buyers win alongside the creator. It turns social engagement into something you can participate in, not just observe, a loop where 
attention, belief, and capital all feed into each other.

Zora has shown strong momentum in 2025. Usage has climbed meaningfully throughout the year, with growth concentrated around a few major 
onboarding waves. In June, Zora averaged 1,800 daily unique creators and 5,500 coins created per day. By late July and early August, during its 
ﬁrst real breakout moment, those numbers surged to 18,200 daily creators (up 921% from June) and 43,400 coins created per day (up 697%). 
Activity naturally cooled from those peaks, but the reset still landed far above where the platform started. In November, Zora averaged 13,300 
daily unique creators and 34,800 coins created each day, levels that point to real retention and a steadily growing user base. Even if the spikes 
weren’t fully sustainable, Zora translated them into a durable foundation of consistent users. 
Solving for the Demand Side 
In the grand scheme of things, both pump.fun and Zora are still small players in the social media landscape. Pump.fun has only been able to attract 
a few hundred streamers, and Zora’s user base is measured in the thousands, a rounding error compared to traditional platforms with tens or 
hundreds of millions of users. This gap reﬂects unresolved constraints in how these platforms generate sustained demand around social assets. 
Despite recent momentum, pump.fun and Zora run into those constraints in diﬀerent ways. On pump.fun, the challenge is internal. Its existing 
user base is highly active, yet largely indiﬀerent to streamer coins. Traders show little willingness to buy, hold, or repeatedly trade tokens tied to 
               
 


---

## Page 298

297 
individual creators, particularly when those tokens lack a clear connection to the creator’s ongoing success. 
Zora’s problem is external. Although its creator and content coins have a more compelling market structure than pump.fun’s streamer coins, the 
platform has not yet attracted a large user base that shows up speciﬁcally to trade them. As a result, many assets are created, but few sustain 
meaningful liquidity or repeat engagement. 
For both pump.fun and Zora, improving the user experience requires making social assets worth engaging with beyond a single trade. Social 
tokens become more compelling when ownership unlocks concrete actions, access, interaction, prediction, or routing user spending, such as tips, 
subscriptions, or advertising back through the asset itself. Importantly, Zora has already begun moving in this direction with features like 
token-gated direct messaging. 
Future Outlook 
These challenges are not a reason for despair. Both pump.fun and Zora are early, and their shortcomings point to design problems that are solvable 
rather than structural dead ends. Financialized social media remains an underexplored surface area, and even modest improvements in how users 
engage with social assets could unlock signiﬁcant growth from today’s small base. 
At this stage, however, we are far more bullish on Zora’s social growth prospects than pump.fun’s. This is not a knock on pump.fun; the platform 
has built a massive and highly active user base. The issue is one of intent. Pump.fun users primarily show up to speculate on memecoins and new 
launches, rather than developing durable relationships with individual creators or streamers. As a result, social features struggle to gain lasting 
traction. 
In that context, it likely makes more sense for pump.fun to double down on its core product rather than force a social layer onto a user base that 
has not shown sustained demand for it. Recent moves such as Spotlight and the acquisition of the trading terminal Padre may already signal this 
strategic shift. 
Zora, on the other hand, enters 2026 with far more favorable tailwinds. First and foremost, Coinbase appears to be all in on the idea that crypto 
can reshape social media and the creator economy. They’ve completely reworked Coinbase Wallet into the Base App, with a strong emphasis on 
social features. The app integrates directly with crypto-native social platforms like Zora and Farcaster, and the consistent marketing message has 
been simple: help creators earn. As the largest crypto company in America, Coinbase gives Zora an unrivaled distribution advantage, arguably the 
single most important ingredient for scaling a new social platform. 
Another major tailwind for Zora is speculation around the upcoming BASE token. In September, Base conﬁrmed that it is “exploring” the launch 
of a native token for Base. Although no further details have been announced, it is not hard to imagine Base using the token to incentivize activity 
around the Base app, including Zora. 
Zora’s ﬁnal, and perhaps most important, advantage over pump.fun lies in its monetary model. Pump.fun relies on SOL as its monetary asset, with 
both the platform and creators monetizing almost exclusively through trading fees. This structure implicitly rewards volatility and churn. Coins 
that spike, collapse, and generate high turnover are more proﬁtable for the platform and creators than coins that compound in value and reward

298 
long-term holders, leaving trader outcomes largely unaligned with platform incentives. 
Zora addresses this mismatch by adopting an application money model. By using ZORA as the base monetary asset, value created on the platform 
is internalized rather than leaked to an external settlement layer. As activity increases, demand accrues to ZORA, aligning creators, users, and 
traders around the same outcome: a stronger base asset. In this model, the success of individual creator/content coins reinforces the health of the 
broader ecosystem, rather than existing as isolated fee-generating events (see “Cryptomoney Is the Foundation of the Industry” for a deeper 
discussion). 
 
Zora’s application money model is already showing early signs of working in practice. Because all creator and content coin liquidity is routed 
through Uniswap V4’s singleton contract, growth on Zora can be approximated by tracking how much ZORA is deposited into Uniswap V4. 
ZORA deposits in Uniswap V4 have trended upwards throughout the entire year, despite signiﬁcant volatility surrounding the ZORA token. 
Deposits have surpassed 121.5 million ZORA (equivalent to $5.9 million), a 66x increase over the last six months. Beneath the noise, this is the

299 
clearest indication that Zora is ﬁnding early PMF with a subset of creators and users, positioning it well into 2026. 
Exotic RWAs 
One of the biggest trends outside of crypto in 2025 has been the surging popularity of Pokémon, trading card games (TCGs), and sports cards. 
These products have rapidly expanded from niche hobbies into a thriving multibillion-dollar industry. Market Decipher estimates the sports 
trading card market at $14.9 billion, while Zion Market Research values the trading card game market at $7.4 billion, together suggesting a 
combined market of over $22 billion. 
 
Beyond headline estimates, the surge in demand reveals itself in secondary market prices for popular cards. For example, the average price of an 
ungraded Mew Ex #232, one of the more sought-after cards within the industry, has increased 360% since January 2024, from $112 to $516. This 
is just one card, but it illustrates the signiﬁcant new demand that has entered the space. 
With trading cards and collectibles breaking into the mainstream, crypto has an opportunity to solve fundamental pain points (or ineﬃciencies) in

these markets through tokenization. And we’re already seeing it happen. A good example is the rise of onchain gacha-style pack openings. For 
more than a century, collectors have opened packs in the same way: you buy a sealed pack, rip it open, and hope for a hit. In 2025, onchain 
marketplaces like Courtyard, Collector Crypt, Phygitals, Beezie, Emporium, and Rip.fun took that same idea and rebuilt it on blockchain rails. 
These platforms ship physical trading cards to secure vaults and issue tradeable NFTs that can be redeemed for the underlying card. The main 
driver of their activity has been the Gacha-style mechanics, where users purchase randomized “sealed” packs of tokenized cards, which can then 
be digitally “ripped” to reveal the cards within the pack. Unlike traditional Gacha systems, which are constrained by slow, manual card shipments 
through illiquid secondary markets, onchain implementations oﬀer near-instant liquidity as marketplaces provide buyback mechanisms that return 
80%-90% of a card’s value immediately. 
 
Onchain gacha is clearly ﬁnding strong PMF. In November, the top six marketplaces facilitated $62.2 million in volume, up from $10.4 million in 
January, representing a 497% increase over the previous eleven months. At the current pace, onchain gachas are on track to clear over $600 
million in volume in 2025. For reference, GameStop’s “Collectibles” segment generated $439.1 million in the ﬁrst half of 2025 ($878.2 million

annualized). 
The comparison isn’t one-to-one—gacha platforms earn more per unit of inventory, and GameStop has a broader product lineup—but it still 
highlights how fast onchain gachas have scaled. A year ago, most of these platforms were relatively unknown. Now, they’re handling tens of 
millions of dollars in monthly volume and demonstrating that there is real demand for digital-native ways to interact with physical collectibles. 
This is just one example of a much broader shift starting to take shape. Onchain gacha and tokenized trading cards are likely just the ﬁrst iteration 
of what we refer to as “Exotic Real-World Assets (RWAs).” Exotic RWAs are tokenized representations of goods or assets that are not inherently 
ﬁnancial instruments. While trading cards are the most prominent example today, the category also encompasses fashion items, luxury goods, and 
other collectibles. These asset classes face structural frictions that tokenization can help mitigate, such as reliance on intermediaries, high shipping 
and insurance costs, and fragmented grading and resale workﬂows. 
The ﬁrst wave of adoption has come from onchain gacha, but the larger opportunity lies in bringing the entire collectibles stack onchain. This 
could include grading and authentication recorded immutably onchain, permissionless appraisals backed by economic stake to discourage fraud, 
custody arrangements where ownership transfers without requiring physical movement of the asset, and more. Over time, secondary trading, 
insurance, lending, and dispute resolution could also be natively integrated, reducing reliance on intermediaries and enabling more liquid, 
transparent, and composable markets for non-ﬁnancial goods. If successful, Exotic RWAs could emerge as an asset class that is easier to trade, 
easier to collateralize, and more liquid than traditional collectibles. 
For 2026, we expect onchain gacha platforms to continue leading the exotic RWA sector, driving additional volume and bringing more trading 
cards onchain. Beyond trading cards, other exotic RWAs may also begin to gain traction as infrastructure matures and user familiarity increases. 
Some early examples include Baxus, a marketplace for tokenized whiskey and spirits; Fitted, which focuses on clothing and fashion items; Huch, 
a marketplace for tokenized CS:GO skins; and House Protocol, which is positioning itself as an onchain alternative to eBay. While still early, 
these platforms illustrate the expanding scope of exotic RWAs beyond trading cards. 
Taken together, exotic RWAs represent one of the more promising and underexplored opportunities in the consumer crypto space. As collectibles 
and adjacent consumer goods continue to grow in cultural relevance and economic value, tokenization oﬀers a path to materially improve 
liquidity, transparency, and market access in asset classes that have historically been fragmented and ineﬃcient. 
Disruption Factor: A Proof-of-Concept 
Framework for Evaluating L2s 
Crypto has never suﬀered from a shortage of activity. New chains, new tokens, new narratives - every cycle brings an explosion of innovation and 
noise. However, one question has remained stubbornly diﬃcult to answer: Which projects truly have the chance to make a lasting impact?

Throughout Messari’s history, we’ve applied the best-available frameworks, from traditional valuation thinking to network and market-structure 
models, in search of a reliable, concise way to evaluate projects. Each time, the same ﬂaw surfaced: protocols do not win the same way traditional 
companies do, and no single legacy lens has reliably measured whether a project is compounding durable advantage over time. The signals that 
matter are scattered across various onchain and oﬀchain metrics. Individually, they’re easy to cherry-pick or dismiss; collectively, they’ve lacked a 
consistent, transparent way to be weighed and compared. This proof-of-concept, which we’re calling the Disruption Factor (DF), attempts to solve 
that. 
Why We Built the DF 
Crypto doesn’t suﬀer from a lack of metrics; it suﬀers from a lack of synthesis. Adoption is multidimensional, spanning usage, integrations, 
economics, reliability, and mindshare, yet these signals are often trapped in separate silos that make conviction feel like guesswork for both 
enterprises and allocators. The Disruption Factor was built to ﬁx this, and to do so, it has four guiding principles: 
1. Transparency 
1. Every metric, weight, and transformation is fully open. No black-box scoring. No hidden levers. Analysts, institutions, and builders 
can audit, critique, or fully recreate the DF themselves. 
2. Customizability 
1. Diﬀerent stakeholders have diﬀerent evaluation criteria. Builders see the world diﬀerently from institutions. So the DF is modular; 
users can adjust pillar weights to satisfy their own needs and inputs based on their worldview. Messari provides a default version, but 
the framework is yours to reshape. 
3. Long-Term Thinking 
1. The DF prioritizes durable metrics through its seven pillars. Virality, noise, and speculative ﬂows matter, but they don’t dominate. 
4. Open-Source & Evolving 
1. Just like crypto, the DF is designed to evolve. Inspired by frameworks like ESG scores or credit ratings, it invites community input 
and improvement. As the industry matures, the scoring model will adapt alongside it. 
The Disruption Factor serves as a compass for durability, rather than a signal for short-term trades. Here’s how enterprises, allocators, and retail 
users can put it to work: 
● Enterprise Adopters: Use the DF to quickly benchmark L2s and identify which networks exhibit the most strength in your areas of interest, 
before committing engineering resources. It’s a practical starting map for chain selection and deeper diligence. 
● Investors/Fund Managers: Use the DF as a repeatable diligence layer to compare L2 networks on adoption quality, not just narrative 
strength. Because the pillars and weights are customizable, you can apply your own investment lens, whether you prioritize revenue 
durability, ecosystem depth, or enterprise traction, and see which projects rise under your thesis.

● Retail: Use the DF to zoom out and focus on networks building durable traction rather than short-term spikes in attention or incentives. It 
turns scattered fundamentals into a simple peer-relative score to support clearer long-term decisions. 
The Disruption Factor oﬀers a simple, intuitive framework that cuts through volatility and speculation to clearly identify which projects have made 
the most progress towards achieving a long-lasting fundamental impact in a given sector. In an environment where narratives move faster than 
fundamentals, the Disruption Factor helps us ask and quantify the question that really matters: 
Which projects are likely to drive lasting, fundamental progress over the long-term, and why? 
Methodology Overview 
The Disruption Factor measures how deeply a crypto project has embedded itself into the broader world and into mainstream user behavior. It 
evaluates not just onchain activity, but whether that activity is meaningfully replacing legacy systems, attracting non-crypto users, and turning into 
sticky, long-term adoption. 
To quantify this, we built a composite scoring model grounded in seven pillars:

304 
 
Within each pillar, the DF evaluates multiple quantitative and qualitative metrics. To generate a single comparable score, we follow three steps: 
1. Normalize the data: Each metric is converted into a percentile rank (0–1) relative to sector peers. 
2. Adjust for gamability: Metrics that are easier to manipulate are discounted so they carry less inﬂuence. 
3. Weight and aggregate: Adjusted metrics are weighted, rolled up into pillar scores, and then summed into the ﬁnal DF score. 
Disruption Factor Formula: DF = Σ (Wi × Pi × (1 − Gi)) 
● Wi = weight of the metric 
● Pi = percentile rank (0-1) 
● Gi = gamability score (0-1) 
The DF score (0–100) benchmarks each project against its sector peers: 
● < 50 → Mostly crypto-native adoption; limited external embedment 
● 50–75 → Disruption is material; expanding beyond crypto-native users 
● > 75 → Infrastructure-grade, culturally sticky, systemically relevant

In this proof-of-concept, we scored thirteen L2s to debut the DF. We chose to begin with the L2 sector due to consistent onchain activity, clear 
competitive dynamics, and widely accessible metrics that make it an ideal proving ground for a standardized framework. Over time, we can 
expand the DF to other sectors, tailoring metrics and weights while maintaining the same core pillars. 
 
The results reveal a clear barbell in the L2 landscape: Arbitrum One (70) and Base (67) are pulling away as the leaders, with OP Mainnet (58) 
alone in the next tier. Below that, the ﬁeld compresses under 49, suggesting that many L2s remain early, sector-speciﬁc, or are still proving 
durability. The DF shifts the conversation from “who has the best narrative?” to “what are this chain’s current strengths or areas of opportunity?” – 
pinpointing the pillar gaps that separate tiers and making progress trackable as fundamentals improve. 
Arbitrum One

Arbitrum had the highest DF score of 69.5, leading in just 1/7 pillars, but was the runner-up in two others while ranking as the leader in 3/28 
individual metrics. Arbitrum’s lead is driven by durable DeFi economics, strong netﬂows, and ecosystem revenue, rather than a single breakout 
app, as evidenced by its leading position in the Economic Longevity pillar. Arbitrum has also been attracting a roster of enterprise builders 
(Robinhood, Franklin Templeton, and WisdomTree), reinforcing that its technology stack is viewed as a reliable base layer for production 
deployments. In DF terms, that combination, economic durability and credible adoption pathways, is exactly what separates a top-tier L2 from the 
long tail still proving staying power. 
Base

Base held the second-highest DF score of 67.1, leading in 4/7 pillars and ranking as the leader in 10/28 individual metrics. Base has a structural 
advantage that most L2s can’t replicate: a mainstream distribution channel (Coinbase). Coinbase converts awareness into users and users into 
sustained onchain activity, as evidenced by its leading position in the Usage Depth (Monthly Transactions, Chain Revenue, and Throughput), 
Sentiment & Narrative (Messari mindshare), and Project Stated Goal (DeFi TVL and Active Users) pillars. From the app thesis perspective, Base 
continues to be an oft-chosen chain to deploy on and houses notable DeFi and Consumer apps, such as Aerodrome and Zora. 
OP Mainnet

OP Mainnet held the third-highest DF score (58.2), leading in 0/7 pillars, but ranking in the top three for 4/7 pillars, as well as for 7/28 individual 
metrics. Its edge comes from mature governance and the most prominent retroactive public goods funding ﬂywheel in the L2 landscape, creating 
durable alignment and compounding ecosystem pull, reﬂected in its strength in the Network Eﬀects pillar. While the Optimism Superchain thesis 
is deﬁned by shared OP Stack standards and alignment across OP Chains, we score OP Mainnet on a standalone basis because the DF measures 
observable, chain-level durability today; any Superchain-wide upside should only lift OP Mainnet’s score once it shows up in OP Mainnet’s own 
usage, economics, and integrations.

Stablecoins Enter the Daily Lives of Billions

Stablecoins became the topic dejure in 2025; every crypto company pivoted to them and every ﬁntech started building out a strategy of how they 
were going to adopt them. As a result, we saw traction and PMF in several important use cases, including remittances, corporate treasury, and 
stablecoin issuance. In 2026, the trees we planted will begin to bear fruit: we’ll see traditional ﬁntechs and payment companies start to build 
stablecoin products at scale, and stablecoins will begin to reach the everyday user. 
Remittances. Major platforms like Remitly, Zepz, Western Union, and Moneygram have come out publicly announcing their plans to integrate 
and adapt stablecoins into their platforms. As these products launch, we will see the impact on their business which will push every major 
remittance company to follow suit. By the end of 2026, stablecoins will be the underlying infrastructure of global payments. 
Corporate Treasury. On a larger scale, businesses have begun to adopt stablecoins to move funds between global partners and entities faster and 
cheaper than ever before. Multinationals such as Starlink and Stripe are already moving millions of dollars a day via stablecoins and companies 
such as Beam (Modern Treasury) and Rail (Ripple) are being acquired to expedite product adoption. Public data will show B2B and treasury 
payments reaching into the hundreds of billions in volume in 2026. 
Stablecoin issuance. After growing 50% YoY in 2025, stablecoin supply will 2x in 2026 to over $600 billion in AUM. The majority of the 
increase in supply will come from platform-speciﬁc stablecoins such as USDH, CASH, and PYUSD compared to general purpose stablecoins. 
The distribution of market cap will continue to democratize with newer players eating into market share. The majority of enterprises that launch a 
new stablecoin product will also issue their own stablecoin on platforms such as Bridge and Anchorage. 
While many may think of 2025 as the year of the Stablecoin, 2026 is when they truly get put into the hands of users and enter the daily life of 
billions of people globally. 
Morpho Grows its Lending Market Share 
Author: Toe Bautista @ GSR 
 
Aave’s liquidity, brand, and process power remain among the most underappreciated moats in crypto. It exhibits power-law dynamics across 
nearly every dimension: ~98% of collateral is BTC, ETH, or stablecoins; 80–85% of revenues come from interest income; and ~80% of activity 
remains on Ethereum. As such, ETH and BTC market cap are the primary drivers of Aave’s market share. This is a feature and a bug. In bull 
markets, when BTC and ETH appreciate, Aave’s outstanding borrows tend to increase as users seek leverage. However, Aave’s overreliance on 
speculation causes activity to compress in bear cycles when price unwinds. While eﬀective in the current paradigm, Aave remains beholden to the 
growth of those existing assets and is unlikely to support more complex collateral types, such as equities or tokenized RWAs.

Conversely, Morpho’s trajectory has meaningfully diverged. As of Jan 2024, both Aave and Morpho’s borrow activity had a 0.8–0.9 correlation 
with ETH’s price. Morpho’s correlation has since dropped to 0.4 while net borrows grew >400%. For BTC price, Aave borrows have a 0.8 
correlation, compared to 0.4 for Morpho. 
This illustrates why Morpho is well-positioned to gain market share: it enables product diversiﬁcation and broader user behavior independent of 
speculative cycles. In contrast, the inability to oﬀer ﬁxed-rate products constrains Aave’s borrow-side TAM, especially for RWAs. Institutions are 
disincentivized to use Aave when they must continually requote positions as variable rates move. Morpho V2 solves this through ﬁxed-rate, 
cross-margin loans. Given the clear demand for ﬁxed-rate exposure (see: Pendle’s $40 million in 2025 revenue), Morpho’s modular architecture is 
better suited for exogenous collateral while isolating risk across collateral types. 
As corporates and ﬁntechs expand their onchain presence, Morpho is architecturally better positioned than Aave to capture this wave. In fact, 
Morpho partnered with Coinbase and Revolut; Aave acquired Strobe Finance, emphasizing both the market’s preference for modular money 
markets and the widening divergence in GTM. Finally, Aave’s limited product optionality and reliance on ETH-driven speculation weaken its 
moat. By contrast, Morpho’s strategic partnerships and modular design set it up to meaningfully grow lending market share in 2026, ultimately

Investing in a Meme World 
Author: Kunal Goel @ LayerZero 
One for the Memes 
Memecoins have won. They have succeeded in capturing the speculative premium in crypto. In earlier cycles, crypto’s speculative fervor was 
focused on altcoins, which mostly served as attention coins for their sectors. A particularly notable example was the repricing of metaverse tokens 
after Facebook rebranded to Meta in October 2021. 
 
This kind of speculative price action now happens mostly in memecoins, and less so in alts. The eﬀect of this shift is clear in a prescient post by

memecoin proponent Murad. 
 
The Post-Memecoin Era 
The performance of most alts in 2025 suggests that Murad was right: memecoins now capture most speculative demand. This, however, creates an 
opportunity: the altcoin sector now trades much closer to its fundamental value. Altcoins with improving fundamentals in such a market are 
especially attractive, particularly where they have been written oﬀ by market participants and have become contrarian. 
Through that lens, I’ll evaluate the fundamentals of LayerZero, the project I know best. The same framework can be used to identify and evaluate 
other projects in the post-memecoin era. 
Winning Category 
LayerZero was created for a multichain future, a thesis that is rapidly playing out. 2025 saw new chain announcements and launches from large

crypto and traditional companies including Stripe, Circle, Tether, Monad, MegaETH, and more. As crypto becomes more mainstream, a growing 
multichain ecosystem will further increase demand for interoperability. 
Category Winner 
LayerZero dominates interoperability across every metric. In 2025, LayerZero had ~65% market share in crosschain messages and ~80% market 
share in crosschain volume among general messaging protocols (excluding Circle’s CCTP). LayerZero’s dominance stems from supporting a large 
number of high-quality chains and assets. 
Growing PMF 
LayerZero has found strong product-market ﬁt in interoperable stablecoins. LayerZero supports more than 60% of all stablecoins in crypto, 
including USDT through its Legacy Mesh, USDT0, Ethena’s USDe, PayPal’s PYUSD, Wyoming’s FRNT, and more. LayerZero also supports 
other major crypto assets such as WBTC, WETH, EtherFi’s weETH, and XAUT0. 
Value Capture and Buybacks 
LayerZero acquired Stargate and launched a swaps product in Q3 2025. Verticalizing through Stargate allows LayerZero to build a 
consumer-facing product and directly capture value. All proﬁts from Stargate products directly support ZRO buybacks. 
Additionally, LayerZero Foundation and LayerZero Labs conducted large discretionary buybacks in H2 2025. In the future, the protocol’s fee 
switch can be turned on to programmatically buy back ZRO. Cumulatively, LayerZero executed among the largest buybacks of any crypto project 
in 2025. 
Looking Forward 
Murad was right: memecoins have won. But that victory creates opportunity in places where market participants are no longer paying attention. In 
my view, LayerZero is one of those opportunities.

are mostly driven by speculation which is a much smaller TAM. But the lines between permissioned and permissionless assets will continue to 
blur, so it will grow in time. 
This process is way longer than crypto likes, but that TAM is way bigger. Trillions of dollars and billions of users. 
2026 is Shaping up to be the Year of (Equity) Perps 
Author: Sunny Shi @ Syncracy Capital 
 
The relationship between traditional ﬁnance and crypto has matured greatly in 2026. This year, we saw worlds collide, with Wall Street 
experimenting with crypto IPOs and DATs while onchain participants opened the ﬂoodgates to mass stablecoin and RWA adoption. This period of 
interchange has revived TradFi interest in crypto concepts, while crypto natives increasingly recognize that RWAs are a path towards bringing 
higher quality modes of ﬁnance and speculation onchain. 
Perp DEXs are relatively underdiscussed by TradFi outlets yet are a clear beneﬁciary of this cross-pollination. For example, equity perps import 
RWAs onchain in a format that is appealing to crypto natives, while exporting our crypto rails to new traders who now have permissionless access 
to highly levered stock and commodity futures. The underlying innovations that perp DEXs bring to the table are vast. These are fully solvent and 
transparent onchain order books that could allow anyone in the world to speculate on assets at previously unimaginable levels of leverage. 
Perps are: 
● More capital eﬃcient than traditional levered margin products 
● More digestible for retail given their simplicity 
● More eﬀective for certain trades when compared to options 
● Better for market participation if 24/7 trading is unlocked 
A South Korean trader on Hyperliquid can now place a 10x levered GOOGL long Saturday night without worrying about expiry, decay, and 
convexity. Astoundingly, they can do this without relying on a traditional brokerage account. 
Furthermore, DEXs may get a head start on equity perps simply because they can move faster and build natively around the mechanics that perps 
require (real-time margining, instant liquidations, and vertical integration). Centralized exchanges, especially those tied to TradFi frameworks, 
face slower product approval cycles, legacy clearing models, and stricter regulatory boundaries that limit how quickly they can introduce new 
derivatives formats. By contrast, DEXs can iterate openly onchain, experiment rapidly, and launch globally under the current regulatory regime 
that has been relatively hands-oﬀ. This agility gives them a natural advantage in shaping the earliest and most compelling versions of equity perps. 
In less than two months, Hyperliquid has already surpassed $5 billion in cumulative trading volumes on their HIP-3 products. Perhaps, this is the 
unlock we need to push the DEX:CEX ratio higher in the futures category. 
To conclude, it is entertaining to watch crypto pundits complain about the lack of innovation within the arena, while tokenization, stablecoins and

prediction markets have become the talk of the town amongst external investors. These aforementioned narratives existed in prior cycles, but even 
in the mania of 2021, few predicted they would evolve into the global phenomena that they are today. My view is that the perps phenomenon is 
coming into form onchain right now, with an opportunity set that is just as expansive waiting to be realized and recognized. I believe that 
in 2026, equity perps will onboard new users onchain and attract growing exogenous investment appetite for crypto narratives. It is highly possible 
that equity perps develop into crypto’s newest killer use case while also becoming TradFi’s new crypto ﬁxation. 
Pricing TGEs with Prediction Markets 
Author: Amir @ Keyrock 
 
In 2026, Prediction Markets will operate as a direct market for future outcomes that institutions and users rely on to price risk, hedge 
uncertainty, and act on information in real time. 
For institutions and retail users, prediction markets represent the simplest form of derivatives. They function as binary contracts with ﬁxed 
payouts and capped risk, without the structural complexity of traditional instruments. They remove the need for volatility assumptions, 
discounting models, margin, time decay, and strike selection. As a result, they are uniquely suited for hedging discrete events such as earnings, 
product launches, and macro releases, without exposure to implied volatility crush. 
More importantly, prediction markets allow participants to hedge the event itself rather than its ﬁnancial proxy. Instead of expressing macro 
risk through equities, FX, or volatility indices, institutions can hedge elections, policy shifts, wars, inﬂation regimes, and regulatory outcomes 
directly. As these markets deepen, their pricing increasingly mirrors institutional pricing and establishes prediction markets as leading 
indicators of macro stress and regime shifts. 
They also unlock entirely new hedging surfaces. Through pre-IPO and pre-TGE markets, investors gain the ﬁrst scalable way to hedge 
private-market risk at scale, a market that remains largely unexplored and spans hundreds of billions in value. Valuations that once appeared 
only on listing day become tradeable probability curves months or years in advance, turning opaque moments into continuously priced 
distributions across multiple strikes. 
Instead of discovering token valuations in a single chaotic listing moment, prediction markets allow TGEs to be priced in advance through a 
market-driven valuation curve. Funds, teams, and protocol contributors submit valuation levels they are willing to trade, while market makers 
aggregate that order ﬂow into structured FDV pricing lines listed as tradable event contracts. 
Once live, this structure creates a public, continuous probability distribution for a token’s future valuation. Teams and early investors can 
hedge without touching the cap table, retail gains synthetic access to pre-TGE risk, and the market itself forms a real-time forward curve for FDV. 
Instead of relying on private rounds or narrative anchoring, token launches become pre-priced, hedgeable ﬁnancial events.As direct event risk 
moves away from proxies, institutions and protocols will begin using prediction markets to hedge real exposure. That shift is what excites me

All Roads Lead to the Wallet 
Author: Justin Baba 
 
Society continues to drift toward higher-risk, gambling-like behavior, and crypto is positioned to capture this ﬂow through products that traditional 
markets do not oﬀer. In 2026, two ﬁnancial instruments should beneﬁt most from this shift: perpetual futures and prediction markets. But the 
largest beneﬁciary will ultimately be the wallets that sit above them. 
Perpetual exchanges once focused exclusively on crypto assets, but upgrades such as Hyperliquid’s HIP-3 now enable permissionless listing of 
perpetual markets for non-crypto categories, including equities. As these capabilities expand, teams will experiment with increasingly niche 
products, such as Pokemon card indices, collectibles, and other long-tail assets. Meanwhile, perpetuals tied to RWAs or commodities allow traders 
to generate higher returns from traditionally lower-volatility assets. If liquidity forms around these instruments, perpetuals could become a 
standard way for investors to express cross-asset theses. 
Prediction markets push this trend further. Platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi have scaled meaningfully over the past year, but the next stage 
will involve leverage, combinatorial trades (parlays), and richer payoﬀ structures. These features will draw in new capital from risk-seeking 
participants, such as sports betters and sophisticated forecasters. Over time, these enhancements will likely be built on top of or integrated directly 
into existing prediction market platforms. 
Although these exchanges supply the underlying infrastructure, the real winner in this landscape is the wallet. Perpetual exchanges and prediction 
market platforms will compete with each other by lowering fees and deepening liquidity, but wallets can aggregate across them, surfacing the best 
execution for the end-user. This is the essence of the Fat Wallet Thesis. 
Distribution, one of the hardest problems in crypto, is far less of a constraint for wallets, since they are one of the ﬁrst interfaces new participants 
create. If a wallet can provide seamless access to trading, swapping, forecasting, and cash conversion within a single application, users have little 
incentive to leave. This positions the wallet as the primary consumer-facing interface for all of the user’s activities. Phantom already demonstrates 
this dynamic: traders can access Hyperliquid’s equity perpetuals, swap via Jupiter, and convert assets to cash without leaving the app or 
understanding which protocol they are interacting with. 
Looking ahead to 2026, wallets will continue adding features that abstract away the underlying protocols. This is only the beginning. Over time, 
wallets may integrate traditional ﬁnance tools as well, becoming the consolidated home for a majority of an individual’s ﬁnancial activity. 
Rise of the Crypto Yield Engineer

How Being Delta-Neutral on Aerodrome Delivers 20–40% APR — and Why 2026 Belongs to Protocol Cash Flows 
- 
Somewhere. Out there. In the deepest corner of the bear market, a fund with a comfortable eight ﬁgures of AUM hasn’t lost its appetite for risk. 
This fund just wants 20% annual returns and is willing to dance at the edge of the risk curve to ﬁnd it. But it doesn’t play the ticker game — it 
specializes in yields. And, so, it sets out on a hunt for creativity in the market. 
Enter the delta-neutral Aerodrome trader. The yield-seeking fund hires a sleuth who discovers a seven-ﬁgure portfolio of veAERO, quietly 
collecting 31% APR weekly, with all gains converted to and held in USDC. 
At ﬁrst the fund assumes the trader is running a naked long AERO bet. Then the sleuth uncovers a perpetual short position on Hyperliquid under 
the same wallet address matching the size of the trader’s locked AERO. With funding rates running positive, the trader is earning roughly 11% 
annualized funding income — on top of the 31% APR from fees and bribes (the yield sources on Aerodrome). 
This isn’t speculation. It’s synthetic yield engineering. Across mid-sized funds in 2026, the hunt is on — not for price, but for protocol cash ﬂows. 
And crypto is notorious for seeding quick, high cash ﬂow platforms. Aerodrome’s veAERO isn’t a token play. It’s a yield machine that can be 
delta-hedged. “Smart capital” is sick of chopping themselves up on volatility and chasing narratives. They’ll lock, short, and harvest. 
Many funds (and retail) bled out in 2025 chasing momentum or picking the wrong tickers. The funds looking to learn something are realizing that 
they could have been pulling in 20-40% yields as active participants of various crypto protocols instead of losing over a quarter of their book 
while speculating on Binance. 
It’s true that synthetic yield engineering is not risk-free. The major operational risk lies in Gamma PnL — the cost incurred from dynamically 
rebalancing the perp short as the underlying (e.g., AERO) price moves, especially during rapid, volatile spikes. Furthermore, the single-most 
threatening variable is a sustained ﬂip to negative funding, where the cost of maintaining the short position outweighs the income from fees and 
bribes, eﬀectively making the hedge a cost rather than an additional source of yield. 
Regardless, the trade-oﬀ is calculated and the risk is operational (cost of hedging, basis risk) rather than based on directional price movements. 
This is the fundamental, structural advantage. It allows the creative asset manager to isolate and capture the high cash ﬂows inherent in crypto 
protocols while sidelining the volatility that most folks are unprepared to handle. 
So what’s the 2026 thesis again? 
That crypto funds and retail investors will ﬁnd more alpha in savvy risk management over asset selection. Our industry produces the fastest 
$100+ million revenue companies and will continue to grind out more opportunities where fees are captured. Picking tickers is a crowded and 
often rigged game. The skillset of the next cycle will favor creativity over gambling, valuing those that can build new delta-neutral yield strategies 
that scale to seven or eight ﬁgures and reliably harvest DeFi cash ﬂows. 
P.S. 
I’ll be posting a slightly more detailed follow-up of the AERO strategy on X.

Crypto Sentiment Will Improve 
Author: Nick Garcia @ Breed 
 
The crypto economy entered 2025 with sentiment at all-time highs: BTC was on the verge of breaking the six-ﬁgure level, Darth Gensler was 
gone, and the dawn of the crypto capital of the world was approaching. Fast forward to EOY, and sentiment is at all-time lows despite getting 
everything we wanted from regulators. So where does that take us in 2026? 
First, token holder protections will be top of mind. Gone are the days when token holders will accept being the funders of the Bali slow rug. The 
medicine thus far has been MetaDAO ownership coins, but expect new models to emerge. 
Second, crypto-native protocols will accelerate their adoption of and interoperability with equities. Hyperliquid is the clear early winner with 
equity perps, but expect new projects to follow suit and DeFi adoption emerge. 
Third, the stablecoin duopoly will further erode and more major protocols will launch native stablecoins to capture the yield. USDH was the 
canary in the coal mine, and Ethena’s Stablecoin-as-a-Service provides the infrastructure for projects to launch their own native stablecoins, with 
Sui, MegaETH, and Jupiter as the ﬁrst customers. 
Lastly, crypto sentiment will improve. If you are a multicycle-surviving cockroach or divinely protected individual still here, you are not going 
anywhere. However, collectively we must avoid succumbing to the prisoner’s dilemma and recognize that things need to change in 2026. I believe 
the market has shown its hand post-10/10 as to what that will entail. 
Crypto’s Transition from Asset Class to Tech Sector 
Author: Maartje Bus @ The Medici Network 
 
For years we’ve treated crypto as a single asset class because that’s exactly how it behaved. Now, that label has become misleading. 
The Great Decoupling 
Crypto is increasingly shedding the “asset class” label because its components no longer move together or share a common risk-return proﬁle – 
the deﬁning requirement of an asset class in the ﬁrst place. Bitcoin now behaves more like a macro store of value: volatility has structurally 
declined, institutional participation has deepened, and its price action is increasingly decoupled from the rest of crypto. Ethereum and major 
L1/L2 ecosystems, by contrast, trade more like high-growth technology infrastructure, with performance tied to adoption, fee generation, and 
application-level activity rather than broad market sentiment.

Infrastructure Over Ideology 
Beyond market behavior, this divergence reﬂects a deeper structural shift. Blockchains and core crypto primitives are increasingly understood not 
as ideological alternatives to existing systems, but as infrastructure for re-platforming ﬁnancial services and enabling new digital primitives more 
broadly. The early emphasis on decentralization as an end in itself is giving way to a more pragmatic focus on utility, reliability, and integration. 
Stablecoins are the clearest expression of this shift: widely used, tightly integrated into existing ﬁnancial ﬂows, and largely abstracted away from 
the end user. Increasingly, crypto-native primitives – including lending, settlement, and liquidity – are embedded “under the hood” of centralized 
or regulated applications rather than surfaced as standalone decentralized products. 
Crypto as a Tech Sector 
Bitcoin aside – now eﬀectively a category of its own – this evolution makes the rest of crypto look less like an asset class and more like a 
technology sector, both economically and from an investment perspective – much like the internet. What ties these components together is not 
shared price behavior, but shared infrastructure including blockchains, wallets, middleware, and DeFi primitives. Value creation and investment 
exposure are therefore distributed across multiple layers and can be expressed through a mix of tokens, public equities, derivatives, credit, and 
structured vehicles rather than a single, monolithic trade. 
Looking Forward 
This transition is likely to accelerate through 2026. Blockchain infrastructure is increasingly embedded in real-world ﬁnancial applications rather 
than standalone decentralized products, with stablecoins leading, and payments, lending, and settlement following close behind. Tokenization will 
continue to bring traditional assets onchain, blurring asset-class boundaries in general. A growing pipeline of crypto-native IPOs will expand the 
investable universe, while ﬁnancial “super apps” – combining cross-asset brokerage, payments, credit and other services in a single interface – are 
beginning to take shape, powered by digital wallets and blockchain rails. 
As crypto continues to mature into foundational ﬁnancial infrastructure, many of the characteristics that once deﬁned it will begin to lose their 
centrality – meme-driven discourse, ideology-ﬁrst application design, and synchronized boom-bust cycles. Capital and development will 
increasingly concentrate around economically legible products that deliver clear user value, rather than applications built primarily to be 
decentralized or tokenized for their own sake. 
Parting Thoughts 
This shift matters because it fundamentally reframes what adoption means. Crypto adoption no longer depends on users buying tokens or 
consciously “using crypto,” but on blockchain infrastructure serving as the anchoring layer for value – powering stablecoins today and an

expanding set of tokenized assets over time. While these assets increasingly live onchain, access and interaction are abstracted through wallets and 
platforms that conceal blockchain complexity. As a result, onchain activity and economic relevance can accelerate even as crypto recedes from 
view – reﬂecting its evolution from a traded asset class into a technology sector. 
Bitcoin vs. Altcoins 
Author: Tulip King @ CounterParty TV 
 
I think moving into 2026 we'll continue to see bifurcation between Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market. That’s not to say Bitcoin and 
Altcoins can’t go up or down at the same time, but rather they’ll be doing so for entirely independent reasons. The days of altcoins working like 
“bitcoin-beta” are dead, they were killed in 2025, and they’re not coming back. That means you need to have a framework for both Bitcoin and 
Altcoins looking forward if your aim is to maximize opportunity. 
With respect to Bitcoin: The game is the same it’s always been, money. Make no mistake Bitcoin is in a death match against gold and the dollar. 
Counter-intuitively, I think Bitcoin’s appreciation looking forward will be correlated with the total stablecoin supply (check out Messari’s data for 
this). The more stablecoins we get and the faster, the more Bitcoin should appreciate. If stablecoin supply continues to increment at a glacial pace, 
it’ll be a while before Bitcoin makes any impressive moves. 
This is because we need to drown out all the ﬁlth in crypto that isn’t Money, speciﬁcally the L1 tokens that have been allowed to LARP as money 
for far too long… Yes that means ETH, BNB, SOL, ADA, XRP, you name it — are all going to need to come down to reasonable multiples based 
on fees/net-inﬂation (read: price must come down). The rapid adoption of stablecoins has two cleansing aﬀects: 
1. We can stop pretending these L1 tokens are money 
2. I expect surplus digital dollars to ﬂow into Bitcoin the same way we’ve seen surplus physical dollars ﬂow into gold. 
With respect to Altcoins: I don’t have much to say other than we’re in the “Amazon Bottom” of crypto’s dotcom crash (the ’21 DeFi Summer 
cycle). It’s not going to be easy but for the ﬁrst time I believe there are investable projects that will outperform Bitcoin on a multi-cycle horizon, 
which is something we’ve never really seen before. Just be careful, I believe the projects are going to break the mold of DeFi/L1 slop and come 
from entirely unexpected places. There’s still a lot of falling knives just waiting for people to catch them. 
Crypto AI Becomes Competitive 
Author: Sami Kassab @ Unsupervised Capital 
 
2026 is the year crypto-AI stops being discussed as a moral upgrade and starts being adopted as a competitive one. Founders will increasingly 
recognize that cryptoeconomic protocols let them build AI startups that outperform traditional ones. Not because they’re fairer, but because they

coordinate people, capital, and compute at a speed and scale legacy structures can’t match. The network where most of this experimentation is 
already happening is Bittensor, and in 2026, it will continue to pull away as it attracts the strongest founders. 
The Capitalization of Experience 
Author: Brody Adreon 
Introduction 
To understand where Crypto AI is headed, we must ﬁrst acknowledge where it has failed. 
The initial promise of Crypto AI, the "Airbnb for GPUs," was a brilliant narrative that attempted to address the compute bottlenecks of a 
production-constrained TSMC. As a result, our CT echo chamber parroted decentralized GPU marketplaces such as Nosana, Akash, and Render 
as hyperscaler alternatives, and the industry’s saving grace. 
In reality, these protocols failed to address the latency and orchestration bottlenecks that hyperscalers solve through physical GPU co-location. 
Lacking the synchronicity required for foundational model training, decentralized aggregators were relegated to niche inference workloads. 
Then came the "Agent Meta" of Q4 2024 and Q1 2025. This was the vertical’s most recent ﬂash of excitement, but looking back, these tokens 
were repackaged memecoins masquerading as innovation. They had personality and were fun to interact with, but failed to spawn any real 
economic value, ultimately turning into yet another PvP trading meta. 
Crypto AI has undergone several iterations and much experimentation, but the main problem has been its inability to ﬁnd PMF within the AI 
community and end consumer market. However, a new area of model research has emerged this year that aims to drive value to the researchers 
who leverage it so they can, in turn, produce more performant models and agents for the end consumer: Tokenized Reinforcement Learning 
(RL) Environments. 
My prediction posits that the next great tokenized asset class lies not at the infrastructure or application layer, but in the Experience Layer. This 
new vertical represents a multi-billion dollar opportunity to ﬁnancialize the "long tail" of human experience and nuance, creating a permissionless 
marketplace for the specialized training environments that centralized frontier labs cannot scale independently.

From Static Datasets to Dynamic Gyms 
The bottleneck for increasingly useful AI is no longer “intelligence” or reasoning capabilities, but rather “experience" and functional dynamism. 
Historically, developers attempted to bridge this gap with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT): feeding models static datasets of expert demonstrations. 
While SFT allows a model to imitate a correct answer, it never forces the model to internalize the reasoning required to reach it. 
For example, if you want a "Traﬃc Law Agent," ﬁne-tuning it on a static database of legal codes is insuﬃcient. The agent might know the law, but 
it doesn't know how to navigate the chaotic, edge-case-ﬁlled reality of a contested ticket in a municipal court. 
This is where Reinforcement Learning (RL) replaces static tuning. In RL, agents are not taught, they are raised. They act within a dynamic 
environment, receiving rewards for correct clerical work and penalties for errors. They develop heuristics through millions of simulated 
interactions. 
In 2026, the competitive advantage belongs to whoever owns and contributes to the most robust, complex, and edge-case-rich Environment.

The Environment is the Asset 
Projects such as Prime Intellect, Nous Research, and Aﬃne are working to decouple these environments from the models, transforming static 
datasets and post-training methodologies into permissionless & adversarial environments that ﬁnancialize the learning process and reward all 
stakeholders. 
Consider the Traﬃc Law example: Instead of a centralized company building a simulation, a protocol opens a "Traﬃc Gym" to the world where 
participants earn a stake in the network by actively contributing to the gym's complexity and accuracy. 
● Data Contributor: A user in Austin captures and uploads dashcam footage of a roundabout, a confusing (depends on who you ask) road 
layout where standard self-driving models consistently crash or freeze. 
● Logic Contributor: A law student encodes the speciﬁc local ordinance for that roundabout into the environment, deﬁning the strict 
"ground truth" for who actually has the right of way in that edge case. 
● Validator: A veriﬁed human reviewer grades the agent’s attempt to navigate this new scenario, providing the ﬁnal "reward signal" 
(pass/fail) that updates the model’s weights. 
These participants are capitalizing the environment by systematically closing the gap between general intelligence and speciﬁc reality. They 
identiﬁed the blind spot (the complex roundabout), codiﬁed the rules (the ordinance), and validated the solution (the review). 
As this cycle repeats, the environment transforms from a passive simulation into a productive capital asset: a proprietary, localized compliance 
layer that generates royalties from every autonomous ﬂeet or insurance model that must access this validated ground truth to prevent costly 
accidents or settle liability claims. 
The Value Architecture 
This new asset class functions less like a commodity and more like royalty-bearing IP, shifting the investment thesis from capturing the ﬂeeting 
value of individual, ephemeral agents to owning the dynamic, evolving environments from which inﬁnite agents spawn. 
The value ﬂows through three distinct streams: 
● Access Rent (Training Revenue): Developers must pay to validate their agents against high-ﬁdelity edge cases. Protocols like Aﬃne and 
Prime Intellect have operationalized this mechanism: users pay to access the network's intelligence, and that revenue is programmatically 
distributed to the contributors who provided the resources and expertise. 
● Performance Royalties (Agent Value Capture): This is the moonshot. As envisioned in Symbolic Capital’s "World's RL Gym" thesis, 
the Environment is the ultimate constraint on intelligence. By combining this with Prime Intellect’s "model ownership" primitives, smart 
contracts can enforce a fee switch on an agent's future utility, returning a portion of its revenue to the environment that trained it. 
● Standardization Premium: Investors speculate on which speciﬁc environments become the essential "courseware" for a vertical. Nous 
Research is facilitating this via Atropos, their open-source RL framework. Rather than a single "Global Standard," Atropos enables a

composable market of thousands of specialized, immutable "ground truth" environments. Models are rigorously validated against this 
diverse suite of stress tests, accruing value to the speciﬁc environments that provide the necessary nuance to certify an agent as an expert. 
Applying this to our Traﬃc Agent example, the economic cycle is complete: The ﬂeet operator pays rent to the network to train on the "Austin 
Roundabout" edge case, the agent pays royalties back to the stakers from the revenue it earns settling insurance claims; and the Environment 
token itself accrues a premium as it establishes itself as the only veriﬁed standard for Austin municipal traﬃc law. 
Conclusion 
If 2025 was deﬁned by the commoditization of intelligence, 2026 will be deﬁned by the capitalization of experience. 
The community has pivoted from competing on hardware to unlocking its true wedge: coordination. Tokenized RL Environments empower the 
open-source community to curate a library of skill too complex, localized, and dynamic for any single corporation to replicate. 
This is Crypto AI’s ultimate promise and original intention: using distributed incentives to turn human nuance and experience into the scarcest 
asset in the machine economy.

Biggest Conviction for 2026: HYPE, HNT, HOOD, COIN 
Hot Take(s): 
● Marginal appetite for speculative trading is ﬂattening in the current environment. 
● As a result, crypto’s primary growth driver in 2026 is likely to be RWA tokenization, whether expressed through spot markets or perps. 
● A secondary growth vector will come from net new assets and use cases that can launch faster and at lower cost by leveraging onchain 
infrastructure, rather than going through incumbent centralized venues or building bespoke rails. Compute, energy, robotics, and AI will be 
the core domains, each demanding novel markets and crypto native infrastructure.

Biggest Conviction for 2026: 
● Despite copycats and incentives from emergent competitors, Hyperliquid will continue to dominate the decentralized perps landscape, 
further entrenching its position as a network, not just an app. 
● L1s/L2s with leverage over stablecoin issuers will continue launching native stablecoins to capture value, like Hyperliquid and MegaETH 
have done. Arbitrum is the perfect candidate for one. 
● Stablecoins with exotic yield sources will continue to proliferate. Given their nature, more will blow up than just xUSD and deUSD. 
Hot Take(s): Pressure for revenue generation will continue to mount in 2026. Protocols that do generate revenue should conduct buybacks while 
leveraging the token allocations at their disposal to grow the protocol.

Biggest Conviction for 2026: Solana Perps will come back to glory through Phoenix, Bullet, Bulk, and Jito BAM. Solana Prop AMMs will start to

reach $1B FDV. Multiple breakout apps will come from the Monad ecosystem and surprise the fudders. 
Hot Take(s): 
● Solana market structure will continue to innovate and through Prop AMMs price discovery will be onchain for multiple days if not weeks 
for SOL. Price discovery will also happen for non-SOL assets during launch which we saw with ORE and MON.

Biggest Conviction for 2026: 
● The largest asymmetry looks to be ownership coins. I can see these kinds of tokens/tokenomics attracting sophisticated capital and bringing 
ample ﬂows. This does not have to be under the MetaDAO umbrella (e.g., Dupe). 
● More speculative is EDEL, self-custodial, tokenized stock lending market on Base. 
● On a longer time horizon is HYPE and ZEC.

● Stocks: Tesla (EV+Humanoid), Google (Skynet) 
● Metal: Silver (as money and as bleeding edge conductor, AI race) 
Hot Take(s): Market is not interested in a product’s token if it does not accrue value alongside the protocol. XPL is a good example. Yes the 
product is good but the token is designed to be sold/incentivize liquidity to the chain so you cannot “invest” in the chain by buying the token. This 
will continue to manifest in other ways like rerating nonsensical tokens associated with protocols downwards, leaving signiﬁcant opportunity for 
tokens with value accrual built in (this does NOT explicitly mean buybacks) to soak up that liquidity as it moves away from those purely 
speculative assets. MetaDAO launches, Dupe, Hype, Pump technically ﬁts the description but not interested currently. US (Talus on SUI).
