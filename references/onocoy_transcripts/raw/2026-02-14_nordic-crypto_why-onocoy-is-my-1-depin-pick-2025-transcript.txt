onocoy might be my top DePIN project overall for 2025 and 2026. I even ranked the onocoy miner first in my top five miners for 2025 video. In this video I thought I would explain the four reasons why I'm this optimistic about onocoy. And before we dive in, at the end of this video I will leave a big surprise that you don't want to miss. First a 20 second recap of what onocoy is. onocoy is a project building a decentralized GNSS correction network that makes existing GNSS data accurate, reliable and tamperproof. This means that they are able to deliver high precision positioning down to centimeter level accuracy which is gamechanging for farmers optimizing crop deals drone operators or robots needing precise navigation and countless other use cases. This is done by onocoy's community-driven network that lets anyone worldwide set up one of these GNSS reference stations to provide data for this high precision service. We the station deployers are rewarded with BONO tokens right now or the ONO token later for providing this data using these stations or miners. So far there are only about 5,000 of these onocoy stations online globally so we are still very early here. If you are interested in setting one of these up and mining with an onocoy station check out this video here that I will link to below. Alright reason number one to why I'm so optimistic about onocoy. And the first one is their leadership, specifically the co-founder Daniel Ammann. Daniel is a major figure within the GNSS industry recognized for his technical expertise and contributions, including receiving the GPS World Leadership Award in 2016. He co-founded u-blox, a Swiss company that's a global leader in positioning and wireless communication technologies. And to give you an idea, u-blox provides the semiconductor chips powering GPS in over 80% of cars on the road today, plus also some laptops drones and other autonomous systems. So while u-blox have pioneered the GPS semiconductor technology it has also explored real-time kinematics RTK solutions for industries like agriculture and robotics. Although RTK remains a smaller part of the revenue stream. With onocoy Daniel is applying his decades of his technical expertise to their blockchain powered GNSS vision. And the traditional web2 tech world knows and listens to Daniel. And onocoy have leveraged this to focus on creating a product that fits market demand rather than hyping supply growth and struggling for revenue like many other DePIN projects do. So this isn't just another founder chasing crypto trends, Daniel's track record gives onocoy a serious edge in delivering on its promises. Reason number two: investor funding and confidence in their token. onocoy's funding shows strong investor confidence. onocoy have raised over $4.2 million with $2.5 million of those from non-dilutive sources like grants and simple agreements for future tokens, so SAFTS. So SAFTS mean investors are betting on the future value of onocoy tokens rather than taking equity. This matters because onocoy operates as a nonprofit association focused on advancing decentralized GNSS technology, not generating shareholder profits. This structure signals two things. First, investors including industry leaders like the former u-blox CEO Thomas Seiler believe in onocoy's vision to disrupt the $250 billion GNSS market. And second: the nonprofit model aligns onocoy's incentives with its community and mission creating a potentially sustainable ecosystem for token holders and station deployers. So this is a very positive sign for everyone involved with onocoy and its tokens. Reason number three: scalability. onocoy's ability to scale is perhaps the most important part. They use a bring your own device (BYOD) model where anyone can set up their own station using various kinds of hardware. This is a key edge compared with other GNSS correction network projects which only allows people to buy a certain device that they sell themselves, which can be expensive or hard to get for some people. So with onocoy's hardware agnostic approach it lowers the barrier to entry making it easier for people worldwide, including in developing countries, to join the network. And with that comes more stations which means more data which improves onocoy's higher precision service. Reason number four: market demand. Finally, the demand for high precision GNSS is clear and growing fast. The global demand for this service is projected to reach several billions within the upcoming years. So onocoy is perfectly positioned to seize this opportunity. And they are delivering some of the highest quality and performance within positioning services while also offering it at the lowest cost among competitors (sometimes at a fraction of the cost). So pairing this competitive edge with the huge progress onocoy have been making lately, which I'll show you here now, makes me really confident that onocoy could grow a lot. onocoy's network explorer tool lets you estimate token earnings for placing a station in your area. So you can simulate your earnings right here and see how much you would earn in your location if you were to set up a station. They also have this new opportunity map which highlights demand zones for new stations. They also got the sky visibility map which enable us station deployers to see our own stations connection to be able to improve it to maximize our token rewards. onocoy also got the split reward feature that lets you divide your mining rewards among up to five other recipients. So let's say if you want to set up a hardware at your friend's house and you want to split the rewards. The onocoy token generation event, the TGE, is expected to around summer 2025 which is quite soon. And when that happens I think we're going to see a lot more people joining onocoy. So onocoy checks all the boxes for me. A proven founder, strong funding, a scalable model and growing demand for its high precision positioning service. It has in my opinion the potential to become a major success in making GNSS accessible to everyone. Now before I mention the last surprise I want to hear from you, what do you think about onocoy and how many stations have you already deployed? And don't forget if you want to set up your own onocoy station you can check the video here below. Okay, the big onocoy surprise is that from 1st of June to the end of September 2025 onocoy is launching a campaign offering 5x rewards for stations in South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore. And this will apply to up to 500 stations in those regions. The total amount of tokens allocated for this will be 1 million BONO tokens as extra rewards. So if you're located within one of these countries it might be a great time to get involved and earn as many tokens as possible using this campaign. All right thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next one bye-bye
