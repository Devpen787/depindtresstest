[Music] hello everybody Welcome to the deepin podcast I'm your host Tom trobridge I'm thrilled to be here with Daniel the founder um of anoy also the president of the anoy association welcome Daniel hey Tom thanks for having me so listen Daniel talk to us about anoy what is it that you guys do sure so um onoy we are active in the space of high Precision GPS um High Precision GPS where we can take the GPS accuracy of the GPS that you know from your phone and from your car from 2 m level accuracy down to cenm the way this works is that we're compensating atmospheric delays as the signal travels from the satellites down to the Earth we can compensate those delays by measuring that in a decentralized manner by having ations on the planet which measure the satellite signals and then that data in turn can be used to improve the accuracy of moving devices such as tractors drones autonomous vehicles and the like wow that that's super interesting and I think you know there's several projects in the deepin space targeting location and it strikes me that this is one of the areas that deepin is incredibly well suited for to offer a Superior Solution to centralized um providers current providers and so you reference the accuracy improvements that you guys have which is a order of magnitude Improvement maybe two orders of magnitude right so that's remarkable um help us understand that and why a deepin solution is the way that makes that operate versus the centralized existing infrastructure look the thing is the physics side so compensating atmospheric errors in order to improve accuracy that's been well known uh that's been uh done for the last 20 years and there's about 15 20 large players who offer such services in a very traditional in a centralized mode they often do this for um high value low volume applications things like surveying mapping um and with business models that are suitable for such uh such applications now now those operators what they typically do is they operate their own stations so every 50 every 100 kilometer they put up a station so that's typically antenna like like this one and the small box which goes alongside um and in a professional manner that would be super redundant uh backup power supplies back up communications channels so a rather costly piece of equipment and they are putting that in areas where they want to provide service that means they have quite a bit of capital expenditure for acquiring such devices for installing them but then also for maintaining that on a yearly basis um not only does it need power and connectivity there need to be service technicians which service that there's leases to be paid for where it's being installed and so on so it's traditionally seen a rather expensive undertaking if you want to cover say a country or even a continent like say the North America or or Europe that is a pretty costly exercise and everybody is doing that in competition with each other so the big players they operate mostly their own networks and they don't share that with their competitors because they are competitors and that's where deepin comes in and that's also how we position ourselves so we are orchestrating a roll out of a decentralized network by incentivizing individuals to buy such a device so such an antenna and a small box which looks something like like this to operate that put the antenna on the rooftop to operate that and provide us the the data and we are in return giving the cryptocurrency and through that the investment that traditionally would be needed by a centralized organization is shared amongst a large community of individuals who do that for the purpose of earning uh cryptocurrency for the purpose of participating in something good uh in for the purpose of the use cases because in many cases they themselves also need that data and that's why a deepin approach um is is a very feasible one eventually allowing the whole industry to share a one Global decentralized utility Network that everybody can build on top rather than building a new proprietary uh closed system um for yet another application which is what traditionally has been done but with a horizontal approach we are able to provide into or to supply data into those manufacturers and those uh service providers today who have their specific business models for say agriculture for marine for for automotive applications sounds like the an ideal deepin use case right and so this this backs me up to to two things to get into but um first I have to hit one of my pet kind of comments also you guys I would classify you as 100% squarely in the deepin network how would you define deepin just to back it up for a second for people that the space is expanding people are jumping into it do you have a definition that you use for it because my definition you guys are square Le but I'm kind of curious if you have one of those I I think the the abbreviation dpin is spot on these centralized physical infrastructure Network so something physical um something which is of use as an infrastructure uh orchestrated in a decentralized manner there was before the term dpin was coined there was also the the the the term tpin for token incentivized physical infrastructure networks I read the token incentive also into deepin Al in a stronger definition or in a narrow definition that's not necessarily the case I think India goes down to community operating notes and in an orchestrated way so that it builds a network that it builds a utility um for a demand side to use and I think that's common across all the dpin networks you have a supply side and you have a demand side and the goal is to reach at least a equilibrium that's the supply so Al to From toomics perspective that's the toket that go to the supply um are outweighed by the demand side and in our case in the GPS industry there is a large established industry behind using such data services no I was going to say everything you said makes complete sense there's a lot of but there's more I guess I would say controversy or more expansive definitions of some of those words than than um might be obvious and so what I I use is a crowdsourced physical infrastructure secured by or or sorry crowdsource physical infrastructure in a common Network secured and scented by cryptoeconomics which is exactly what you would think and I don't think that's controversial to you but for some people believe it or not it is um let's let's talk about your background because this is a pretty specific Niche area and it seems like you have been working in this area for quite a while and that's one of the things I love about deep in space is we've got find a number of people expert and specialists in particular fields that then gravitate to the space as the most effective way to deploy the technology that they are most you know experienced in and it sounds like you fit in that category let's learn about your experience a little bit so I'm not a I'm pretty new to the whole web 3 crypto deep in scene I started studying this when I learned about the helium project around three years ago um and I was just fascinated by that idea how you can orchestrate a Global Network like in the helium case uh with a with an approach that that just makes perfect sense now my background is I've all of my career I've been in satellite navigation I started a first startup here in Zurich Switzerland in 1997 company called dblocks and in that company me and two co-founders we built up a market dominant player of GPS chips so actual Electronics we would be building chips so semiconductors we would be building modules and sold them on a global market um throughout that we've been able to reach Market leading positions in a number of professional applications um drones cars um robotics uh but also simple things like Fleet uh management and telematics and tracking systems for all work applications in that company we ipoed in 2007 we built up a unicorn uh reached market cap of $ 1.6 billion in 2016 and it's been a great run uh and that company is still around um dominating many of the more professional applications me personally I yeah I left uh 5 years ago I turned 50 I thought I've seen it um but I'm a satellite now ation nerd and I'm again back in by now the third startup um which is onoy where we're not looking at the harder side of things our belief is there's plenty of companies in the industry who built the hardware who built the chips who built the devices the boxes but on the services side there's uh that problem that I mentioned earlier of capex Opex that needs to be solved and here we can make a difference by doing a horizontal layer deepen uh platform that anyone can build on top interesting well I mean that that that sort of hits exactly the key points of of so many leading projects which is helium inspiration expertise in a particular vertical that then deploys um blockchain cryptoeconomics and the deepin kind of ecosystem if you will to provide a solution superior to the traditional um centralized competitors and I mean that is that sort of hits all the points and there's a number of projects like that which I find really um you know super compelling um help us understand um the scale of what you know the centralized competitor would have to deploy versus what you can deploy in a decentralized way in terms of what the um the the the each of the devices cost maintenance you know how many you think you need to deploy to cover X continent country mile however you whatever the metrics however you think about it just to give people senses of scale here sure so if you look at the the major players um that's companies like Trimble hexagon Swift navigation 0.1 and various others on a global scale but there's also National networks Regional networks the typical thing that they do is that they're setting up a station every 50 to 100 kilomet the data that is being received by by such an antenna can be used by by mobile devices in the vicinity of say 20 to 50 kilm and it enables a rapid determination of the location down to subcentimeter accuracy if you go further out it takes longer so there is a tradeoff um the traditional companies they like for investment reasons they'd like to have an as course basing as possible because that's cost that's Investments and that's also maintenance costs whil it's perform from a performance perspective you like to have an as dense Network as possible so you'd rather want to have every 20 kilomet station uh ideally even in a redundant setup uh so that if one goes down that you still have another one I think the the tradeoffs that the traditional providers have are quite different than what you can do in a decentralized mode so a traditional provider they have redundant backup supplies they have um solar power they have redundant Communications channels they lease space and that brings they their capex to around 10 to 15K per station that they newly install also including the the labor cost so they have teams they plan a network roll out uh they have people driving there installing those stations uh lease agreements that need to be signed so it's quite a an effort to do whilst in a dpin mode all people need is uh access to a number of such devices which cost somewhere between 200 to $1,000 depending on how easy they're how plug and playable they are you can even take a Raspberry Pi put a Docker image on it get an AliExpress uh unicor com module and use that so build material of around $200 and you're part of the network or then the other extreme is highend IP67 uh weather proof stations Outdoors for ,000 ,500 and the whole range in between so the the capex in a dpin mode is about a factor of 10 lower 10 to 15 the maintenance cost if you operate a station at your home you typically do have network connectivity through a Wi-Fi or a lan uh you the power consumption is like 5 Watts so that's hardly measurable so the the actual operational cost is relatively low um so that means a station in a network comes somewhere towards say $1,000 um give or take how how much effort you spend into building it yourselves versus having a plug andplay solution um and this actually allow ows getting around those limitations that you have if you go as a traditional provider where you have 15K uh of Investments and say a th000 $2,000 a year for your um for your Opex by having this distributed and having it lower cost to start with the quality of the data is comparable I mean it's not on the same level as the high-end stations are because typically then those High stations they also have a very rigid monumentation um they have rigid calibration procedures we're getting around many of those things by calculating and by measuring and by compensating those things in the cloud um we cannot do this on chain because the data amounts and the latency requirements would be uh too stringent but we're getting around many of those more traditional calibration uh procedures by uh in the onboarding process in the validation process as we take on new stations and what about scale you mentioned every you know whatever was um was it 10 miles or was it 100 miles um um we want to have a station every 15 miles every 20 kilometers in in in every is that but diameter is it like corre oh the thing is um if you remember helium had like a hexagon setup so you would have um those hexes and you put a station there and there will be certain rules if the there's already somebody in that station and not in the GPS uh domain we are um our goal is to have a global evenly distributed Network because it's not a data Communications Network so we don't need to have more uh stations at areas where the usage of the data is higher there's no benefit there's no benefit um but what we need is a three default redundancy because if those stations are operated by individuals anything can happen on that uh system power can go down internet can go down um the antenna can break so we are looking for a three-fold redundancy um and to with the goal of 20 kilm now it's not such that after 20 kilm it's not black and white so performance degrades it takes slightly longer for a robot or a drone to be more active accurate if it's 25 kilm out if it's 30 if it's 50 km out at 100 kilm distance it gets critical it can take even minutes in order to reach that level of accuracy but it's slowly degrading so we have in our toomics and in the way we reward we're measuring the number of stations within certain areas and we're toning down the rewards as a function of the redundancy amounts so if there is three stations within this more or less the same area they all get the similar amounts of rewards if a fourth station comes in then there's a ranking amongst those stations depending on the quality and the investment uh essentially of how good a piece of equipment they have times the availability so times the the op times that those stations have really interesting so help us understand then um since you've you've mentioned it the token economics piece of it in the economics I think that's that's a critical piece of deepin networks overall and I think also just to backtrack you've mentioned the capex reduction from 10 thou 15,000 to 1,000 but I'd actually argue it's it's it's almost 15,000 to zero because that capex isn't born by you at all by the company at all it's born by the community right so it's even a greater reduction yes I know because you need to look at the whole ecosystem right we only the same boat um we're building up the token to to achieve the the right incentives and the right behaviors but in end we're rolling the same boat I mean it's our goal to have people build out that uh Network and have them participate in the success through that uh through the means of a token a value appreci token so we do look at that uh at that cost you need to also keep in mind we're looking for a redundancy on the level of stations whilst traditionally those providers uh the established industry they build redundancy into the box that's why they have redundant Communications channels redundant power but read rather have more people operate those stations um instead of one station being super redundant that's why we are looking at a threefold redundancy so from your 15K to the 1K it's actually 15K to 3K because we like to have a three-fold redundancy ideally so three guys in a certain area now the token um as such is pretty straightforward and you see similar um toomics in almost any of the deep in projects with a supply site you're issuing tokens on the basis of the quality of the data the availability of the data and the redundancy level so the location scale if it's overp populated or not and we doing that on the basis of days so every day that you're contributing data to us we're issuing tokens at the moment our token is not yet listed uh but we still we are issuing points on the Solana blockchain the token is called Bono for beta Ono token and we're transitioning to the actual token which is then also be traded uh in the course of next year uh going from the Bono to the Ono and doing a air drop for the early Bono holders so we've been doing that already since a year and we've been growing the network to about close to 4,000 stations at the moment and was um quite a variety of stations from uh individuals who buy such boxes to existing networks who just can inject their data into our Network and see it as an additional monetization to professional networks who operate say in in a region in Holland um is a is a good example there is a a national network and those people they provide us the data of the network that they do for local business they also provide the data to us we give them the token because we're an additional sales channel to them so that's the token side on the supply side on the demand side we are serving a traditional industry um an industry which is not used to crypto actually in many cases they don't want to hear about it and if they hear about it then they they talk of FTX and scam and all sorts of things so we're not necessarily promoting that we are not hiding it um but we need to build Bridges to that web tool world so that people can come with Fiat with a crypto uh with a credit card and get access to the service so we have an a Fiat interface um where the actual Revenue so when people buy the service will translate into token value appreciation because organizationally we are an association so we cannot have a a bottom line a profit anywhere in the system because we are a Swiss organization which is non nonprofit by definition and through that um all the value that goes into the system goes directly into the token value appreciation either directly because people buy the token and convert this into Data credits that they then can use to use the service or indirectly by a buyback and burn mechanism that we have in the system so help me understand the buyback burn and how you know I think that is one of the unique components of deepen and I think that is actually what I love about bu burn is that no one else needs to find out about your project your token holders could stay exactly the same number they are right now and if you're successful in achieving Revenue right the association is just a constant demand for that token buying and burning it depending on on the numbers which I want to get into and so what I love about that is it sort of upends the traditional cryptoeconomic system where you have to promote and you have to find new buyers and you're always out there trying to promote it bu burn means you just generate your Revenue you work on your business and everything else just happens because you're create you're you're you're you are the demand because of the revenue and I think that model 2025 may be the year that starts to actually kick in and people start to realize that but but we we will see um how how clear is that those is that division the buy burn versus data credits how how specific is that in in in in your in your setup it's deep deeply built into uh the approach that we're taking um and it's the essence of the economy if you take out uh people who buy the token for for investment for huddle for speculation purposes in essence what you're building is a is an economy where you can reflect the token value or whether token value reflects net present value of your project so if you look at it from a traditional Finance perspective a Net Present Value analysis corresponds to the value appreciation if you would take out speculation and Investments and and and huddling and and all those um more defi oriented elements however there's a strong part also on on the token as such um people who invest in the token whether this is investors whether this is Consultants whether this is the team themselves but also retail investors which backed the system in the early days because initially um you have that equilibrium that you need to reach between supply and demand and only once there's a good enough Supply basis a sufficiently dense Network in certain areas demand will grow so there is this uh equilibrium that that needs to be reached which is being bridged by investors and so then help us understand to that point which I also think you know one of my talks I gave I said deepin is not a meme and I think that is kind of exactly what you're talking about frankly some of us wish it was a meme for a while right memes have been doing great but I think you know over the long term we're going to decouple as an industry from that Meme concept part because of exactly what you're saying one of my thesis is that because you're generating Revenue professional investors traditional investors will be attracted to the space because they can understand it in a way they can't the previous ones and evaluate it so I'm I think we're totally am um you know it's great to hear everything you're saying um help me understand help everyone understand the scale here revenue of what you guys can generate how big is this industry what does this mean for what you know what you're capable of of generating in terms of Revenue there is um several Market doters which talk about the overall GPS industry and how big is um at the moment it's about 150 billion EUR in Hardware revenues and around 200 to 250 billion euros in service revenues now service revenues um are all sorts of fundamental services but also added value Services things like maps and Licensing of those maps and various things that build on top if you zoom in to the actual correction data so what makes AG GPS receiver more accurate um you'll see that this is about 10 to 20 million uh sorry 10 to 20 billion of Revenue today served by an existing industry and in there there's a number of special specializations uh on top of the underlying reference Network so our um Sam so served available Market in in our estimation which is a bottom up estimation is about 1 billion uh that we can address in the coming two to three years um uh because what we're doing is we're providing a single based rtk Network that's the technical term for having stations and providing that station data just for then doing something on top either directly consuming it or consolidating it there's additional uh value add by doing the consolidation by doing a um interpolation between data by casting it through satellites for example there is a larger players they broadcast such data through inmar geostationary satellites and for that they need to compress it but that underlying Network that we're working on this is we believe it's about a 1 billion uh Euro opportunity that we can address in a horizontal approach where the existing industry can build on top and is your pricing similar to existing centralized competitors or are you priced at at a discount because it's a a newer service it's um there is two aspects to it one is the actual cost of it and I think more important is what is the business model how it is being monetized if you look at the traditional providers if you go and buy a service they're going to sell you a year worth of service or a month worth of service you have a fixed amount of time that you can consume their service per device so you pay per month per device that then consumes the service if you have 10 devices you can 10 pay 10 times if you don't use the service if you only use the service one day in a month you still pay a full month and what blockchain allows us to do is have a very fine grained microtransaction based payper use business model we're actually calculating on a per second basis and we also offering it in a payper use model because we can because the cost of sales uh through the through chain and we are on solono which the transaction cost is is low and it's High scut um there we can just deduct uh data credits uh on a per usage bases and that is very attractive if you're if you're a farmer and today you need to buy a service and you need to sign up for a service for say $400 doar a year then and you're not using that service 80% of the time you're paying for something that you don't use while in our case um you are paying if you needed Monday morning you're paying for what you've used on Monday morning and not for the full week or for the full month now from an absolute pricing perspective um with that paper use model we're very attractive uh for occasional use for infrequent use for as un need use for service providers so the existing industry who wants to densify their Network or geographically expand there is plans where there's discounts uh which make it highly attractive and much more cost effective also for them to consume a stream from us rather than buying it from somewhere somewhere else from a traditional provider or more importantly operate their own stations so and with thanks to to on chain the economics being on chain we can play those business models in a very efficient way really interesting and so what that also means is that the hurdle to sign people up is pretty small because it's a pay as you use for a consumer it's not a you don't have to sign up for a year-long contract you can sign up and just you pay as you go which is you think would reduce the hurdle um you know one one thing I think is um I'm kind of curious about this gets bit more into the business side you know um a lot of web 3 projects are technology Le we developed a lot of fluen is a decentralized compute platform a lot of years spent Building Technology but we have since really over the past six months been investing in business development in marketing right in the whole traditional business side so I'm I'm guessing from where you guys are that is the real focus of the business now is the actual sales side of it all and getting customers I'm just kind of curious to hear how you think about that because that you know historically the crypto projects were build an L1 and it will come right and and and defi offer rewards and give some high yields and money flows in and we're operating in a bit of a different different environment um in essence yes that's the focus is on the business development side it's building out the demand side it's Bridging the web 3 approach which we are in essence to a web two world and explaining and building bridges for a web to World which is a lot of Business Development it's a lot of Education it's a lot of Storytelling and to explain how that works um so at its core we are doing a business model Innovation not so much a Technology Innovation there is one aspect though maybe two aspects um doing large scale rtk networks with the goal of 100,000 stations on the inbound side on the Node side but also millions of direct connections to devices it's a scalability problem and it's something that can be solved but it's a significant um effort in order to make it um from the cloud side uh that um that's scalable that's also the reason why the actual GPS data is not going on chain because it would be too much it's too latency critical so that is a cloud system um where the system interfaces with the chain with the blockchain to settle the economies so I think that's the technical challenge one the bigger challenge is we are approaching the GPS industry with a harder agnostic mode so you could build a a device so we could build a onoy device um which says onoy on the front and which only works in the onoy network or even a second brand and what it only works with onoy and we have control over the device that people buy we may even get the revenue stream uh from selling that device directly or through a third brand and lock it up however we chose not to do that because there is a large industry of people who build such devices um there's no point in Reinventing devices that um that have been built for the last 10 15 years years so we'd rather use those existing uh providers those existing uh Supply chains with the uh the standards that they have and the interfaces that been do so in our set of nothing on the device is proprietary which also comes with the intrinsic problem that anyone could inject data which is um either synthetic or somehow cooked data and that is not actually coming from a physical device and if you're asking for technical innovation in that project um identifying what is coming from an actual physical device and what is synthetic data that somebody builds a script or trains some AI to generate such such data that is a a challenge but it's a challenge with that is solvable and we've proven this again and again and it's also in the broad context of GPS it is a systematic problem that needs solving spoofing uh which is a technical term in the GPS industry is omnipresent if you look in theaters of War you see a lot of spoofing signals where even over the radio link over the RF a look Alik GPS signal is being broadcast which then the receivers in the field pick up and are being misled so what we are solving uh and a lot of our research and a lot of our development also goes into that is the algorithms to figure out what is actual physical data and what is not that can be done that can be done on the basis of geospatial characteristics on the data of atmospheric characteristics that we can extract also on several aspects um that that you can look in the data and also verify it in real world whether something is physical but coming back to your question in essence it's a business model Innovation but with some pretty interesting also scientific uh approaches that that are being solved you know one question you made me think of and this may be a little bit too specific for for some but I got to ask it anyway you know you mentioned um you know GPS is obviously from um GEOS right Geo geoc syn satellites and geosynchronous orate which are I forget like 33,000 or something miles above the Earth to starlink will starlink offer service because those satellites are so much lower that makes this not as necessary Neary because the latency is so much slower or lower yes so the satellites of GPS and the other major constellations they're about 26,000 kilom above us so they're not geostationary they have an orbit time of twice a day so they're they're coming around the geost station areas will be another 10,000 kmers further out um but it's more or less they're far away um so the the Earth diameter is 6,000 kilm the satellites are like 3 times the diameter away from where we are um that's there is a a class of um projects typically Under the Umbrella of Leo pnt so low earth orbit position navigation and time where uh companies build up networks or satellite systems more on lower cost near Earth orbit uh orbits uh to provide also navigation purposes uh navigation signals you are specifically asked about starlink the starlink signal can be used for navigation purposes Al that they have not been built for that but they're not optimal um because the frequencies at which they're sending and also the signal modulations that is being used is optimized for data Communications which is quite the opposite of a navigation signal a navigation signal has uh needs to be precise because it's all about time measurement as it comes from the satellite Down to Earth but there is a number of companies which build up their own Leo constellations um typically a few hundred satellites um Kona in California is one of those companies where they're building out their own network of Leo satellites and it has also some nice properties because they are low earth orbit their the Dynamics as observed from the surface of the planet is relatively high they come and go within 10 to 20 minutes they come into view and they leave the field of you within that and those Dynamics themselves are helpful for many applications so does that and that is you're I guess your the basic point is starlink is not optimized for location there are Leos that do this but that's a different service and that you're there's still not going to be the service you offer is is still highly competitive with anything those guys could come up with and you still have the whole capex reduction you're not putting satellites in the air you're just using the signal so from a capex and cost perspective you're still materially lower you would imagine yes I mean the Leo pnts they're in competition with GPS GPS and the European the Russian the Chinese counterparts they're free of charge for civil usage so if you build up a private Network you have pretty uh intense Investments that you need to do in order to bring up those hundreds of satellites and you need to recover that from service fees for the for the core satellite signals so we need to have some add added value on top that people are willing to pay for which can be on the level of Integrity on the level of security possibly on the level of performance although performance of GPS and especially also with correction Improvement Services which are cost effective like what we're doing there's the value add of private constellation is probably somewhere else and the data Communications constellations like starlink it's not their focus and the signals are not made for that and they're far away uh frequency wise so you cannot retrofit an existing GPS receiver that you have in your car with starlink navigation capabilities because it already fails at the antenna the signals are just too far away uh from being receivable by that ten gotcha another question for you you mentioned the difficulty of scaling to 100,000 stations as an example and that's possible but difficult does this become and I know there's other um providers out there like geonet and others are doing something similar to what you're doing so do you end up in a world where there's multiple competitors globally or do you think you end up with regional right where one's in focused on Europe and one's in the US so the stations are denser and the network is more specific to a region is that and because customers are more Regional potentially how how do you think about because this is we're in a new world right we used to have deepen one project per per sector we're now moving to a place we're going to have multiple so how do you think that shakes out um the way we're positioning ourselves as a horizontal layer um that's a global that needs to be a global system um and there is a need for a open uh Hardware agnostic infrastructure but also an open and uh service agnostic uh demand side so we're not going into providing the services ourselves for that there's an existing industry and so we believe a horizontal positioning on a global scale is what is needed and sure there is um existing and will continue to exist private networks which are vertically oriented which typically focus on certain use cases whether this is in the agricultural domain or the automotive domain and they have a private Network because they need a more rigid control for the use case that they have or they have very specific business models for those use cases we believe though we uh on a more layered structure where there's an existing industry that can build on top and Below on on the hardare side um good good to know let's um let's talk for a second about governance and I think one thing that the fluence project shares with with anoy is we are both um governed by by Swiss associations and so just give a give give people a little understanding of what an association is and and why you chose it I think a lot of people are more familiar with you know foundations or Cayman you know entities so I think that's just an interesting commonality that we have and I'm curious your perspective on it yes so we are an association which is a a legal vehicle here typically used for football clubs and for stamp collectors and and um such interest groups but it's also being used in large scale um operations like the FIFA the the world um Football Association is at its core it's an association not that this is necessarily a good reference um but uh it is also a tool that allows you or a legal entity that allows you to build up something in a nonprofit Manner and we believe and also the regulat system here allows that that this is the right approach for a system which is owned by a community which is um regulated by governance um you can consider it like a a national legal entity setup that can be turned into a DA at some point in time it's like a pre a real world a paper based da if you want um and that's also our our approach to it um so we started with a Association um we have a governance structure we have the the voting schemes also with some Innovation on that level for example um square root based voting in order to make sure that not a single large token holder can uh Dominate and steer the the project in the wrong direction which we believe is important if we want to serve as a utility to the whole industry we need to have measures in place that that couldn't somebody like uh a big existing and incumbent come with a lot of money just buy up half the tokens and then shut it down because it's not in their interest so we've built methods into the bylaws in the association and also further on in the onchain governance that avoids that by only counting square roots of votes which equals out balance of power gives more power to small token holders and through that the and this Association scheme all house that and it's it's it's a good and a valid and a regulatory compliant way how such projects are being made these days really interesting I mean listen the fluence association we were very we worried about that as well we took a different approach the square root is is a very good one we did a different one where we have a governance committee that can has can veto any onchain vote but that governance committee is elected by the community every two years right they can only veto for up to 2 years and so if someone really wants to take over you theoretically could take over that governance committee but it'd be a two-step process you'd have to oust the committee and then put the onchain votes on do it which is certainly possible but um is is was our way of of of kind of protecting against that because I think that is a very real risk and as these projects get more valuable treasuries gets more valuable I think you will see more potential attack vectors and potential and and Absolut and risks and I think it's also important because we we'd like to parti we'd like to have the existing GPS industry participate in our project not only on either the supply on or on the sum of demand side as a consumer or as a provider of Hardware but also as a strategic uh tool for them to build their business further we'd like to welcome them also as investors and for that we need to make sure that not one um one entity can dominate that that's why the the square root voting um if introduced that we also have a governance committee which is being elected by the by the Association and uh through that voting mechanism it doesn't formally have a veto um on on things that happen uh but there is that means of delegating votes and of um of the the square root which gives us sufficient protection for for such really interesting well um you mentioned helium as being one of The Inspirations one of the early projects that's kind of brought your you know raised your awareness to this whole sector and with some of the inspiration are there other projects that you like that you follow that you're impressed by anything else you want to draw attention to in in the deep in space for for people who are paying attention so I mean the healing project I think is the is the most welln and it's also the lighthouse project and we've studied it quite deeply um and because it proved what is possible with a crowd incentivized setup it also showed the limitations um because they essentially there was no demand um so the actual usage of the initial Laura when Network that they built out there's hardly been any demand so the actual Revenue so the demand side need for the service was just not there um and I think that's also the biggest learning out of the helium project and we believe there the GPS industry is very different there is an existing I mention the the number 250 billion Euro uh business out there and we can uh address the part portion of that which in the Laura case was just not the case because Laura is one out of many iot communication standards and they're all competing and they're all pretty um low Revenue per se um the other learning out of the healing project was the harder side or the economy as such um the helium project early on immediately or not immediately but quickly grew it overheated it and so we've built some measures in place to avoid that this happens so that things stay within reasonable um control as so the tokenomics had some means to to control that but also on the harder side back in the in the days when helium miners cost you $5,000 um because you could make a fortune within weeks of that the actual sellers of the that Hardware they made a lot of money also so the healing project themselves which was the revenue that they did through um activation fees that had to be paid by the people purchasing the hardware so the actual Revenue that they did was on the back of the miners in our setup we cannot do that uh because the hardware is either already out there so there's an installed base um or it's new hardware and we don't want to add additional cost on top of the hardware we'd rather want to go broad I think it's also more transparent play if if it's very clear who participates to what extent on what part of the economy you also about other projects I mean we continued following helium helium also moved to Solana went away from their own blockchain that's why also one of the reasons why we moved to Solana because we could also uh see um how they're using Solana in their setup so we could reuse parts of it there's also flana has become a a bit of a hotspot for deeping project um before deep in specific chains such as Peak started to uh to appear um there is a number of projects hi mapper is an interesting example they also need High Precision GPS in order to do what they're doing but generally I would only look at deepin projects which have a real demand side uh behind it so if you're inventing a new deepin to solve a problem I think the key question to ask is what is demand side how big is it and how big can it grow and if you look at at projects which measure some property say noise pollution or say air or air quality how big a market is for data as such and even wildest of fantasies if you imagine new use case how big could that be I think that demand side should give the value of a project was ultim that's what it is the the value of the token or the FTV of the overall system should be in some relation to the net present value out of what the project can address so I would take this test how big is the demand site today how big can it grow to see where are in the long run the most interesting DP projects un understood totally agree I mean that's also why fluence is targeting compute it's a big there's a lot of demand for compute um but but it's a it's a different different challenge obviously um love to um listen appreciate that how do people follow anoy how do they follow you how do they sign up to buy and install a station how do how do people get involved here so we have a fairly active Discord Community um where people discuss the project where they also exchange installation tips where they talk about using raspberry pies and electronics and build it yourself um we are active on telegram there is a nono Channel we are active on X that is addressing the more web 3 side of things but because we're also playing on or the demand side is a more traditional Market we're also pretty strong on LinkedIn press releases uh websites so you find us at www.on.com um there's on the top there is also links to Discord uh to our telegram Channel to our LinkedIn profs awesome well Daniel thank you so much for joining thrilled to have you here and you know look forward to having you back on once you've got the the token transition to to um complete and you've made a couple more steps I think there's going to be a lot more to talk about so really excited to hear about additional traction which I know is coming I think 2025 is going to be a big year for the industry and certainly for onoy so thrilled about that um thanks for thanks for being on thank you Tom thanks for your opportunity appreciate it [Music]
