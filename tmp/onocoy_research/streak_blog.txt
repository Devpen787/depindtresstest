Introducing Streak Appreciation: Because Reliability Deserves Reward

Oct 17, 2025

[]

[]

At onocoy, we believe consistency is the cornerstone of reliability.
That’s why we’re excited to announce Streak Appreciation: a new feature
designed to celebrate and reward the most dependable members of our
network. Whether you’re a miner contributing data or a client relying on
that data, this update strengthens the foundation of trust that powers
the entire onocoy ecosystem.

What Is Streak Appreciation?

Streak Appreciation is a performance-based bonus system for station
operators. Every day you complete your data collection task, your streak
grows  and so do your rewards.
The concept is simple: Consistency Pays Off. The longer you maintain
your streak, the bigger your daily bonus.

With each consecutive day of active participation, your reliability is
recognized and compensated. Stations that maintain strong streaks can
earn up to +50% more on top of their base rewards. It’s a system
designed to motivate daily engagement while reinforcing the value of
stable, high-quality data supply across the network.

How to Grow (and Protect) Your Streak

Keeping your streak alive is easy, it just takes daily attention and
dedication.

1.  Show up daily: Submit your station data consistently. Each day adds
    to your streak.

2.  Track your progress: Your streak status and bonuses are visible in
    the onocoy explorer dashboard anytime.

3.  Protect your progress: If you miss a day, your streak is halved  not
    reset, but significantly reduced. In other words: don’t break the
    chain!

4.  Stay consistent: The longer you keep it going, the more appreciation
    (and rewards) you’ll earn.

Remember, reliability isn’t just about performance, it’s about habit.
The most reliable miners will always be the most rewarded. To learn more
about it check the docs here.

Why It Matters — Building Reliability for Everyone

Streak Appreciation is more than a way to incentivize earnings,  it’s a
new chapter in how we reward dependability and strengthen trust across
the onocoy network.

For miners, it turns daily consistency into measurable growth. Every
streak is a reflection of reliability: the longer you stay active, the
more you earn, up to +50% in bonus rewards  and the greater your
contribution to the onocoy ecosystem. It’s not just about showing up;
it’s about building a habit of excellence that the entire network can
rely on.

For clients, that same reliability translates directly into better, more
consistent data. By rewarding miners for continuous performance, we’re
increasing the resilience, reliability, and confidence of our network,
exactly what our clients need to ensure they receive higher-quality,
uninterrupted data they can depend on. 

Ultimately, reliability is the heartbeat of onocoy. Streak Appreciation
aligns the motivations of everyone involved  miners who earn through
consistency and clients who benefit from it. The result is a more
sustainable, transparent, and dependable data ecosystem.

This is only the beginning. Streak Appreciation sets the stage for
High-Value Areas (HVA) — a system built to expand onocoy’s reach into
underrepresented regions and enhance data coverage where clients need it
most

In Short

- Consistency Pays Off: The longer your streak, the higher your bonus.

- Up to +50% Rewards: Reliable miners can boost earnings by half.

- Don’t Break the Chain: Missing a day halves your streak — stay steady.

- Reliability Wins: Clients get higher-quality data thanks to consistent
  mining.

- Track It Anytime: Your performance dashboard in the onocoy explorer
  keeps you on track.

With Streak Appreciation, onocoy rewards reliability  building a
stronger, fairer, and more dependable network for everyone involved.

Become a miner, stay consistent, earn more and power the most reliable
data ecosystem on the planet.
