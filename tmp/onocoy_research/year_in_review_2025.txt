onocoy 2025 Year in Review: From TGE to Global GNSS Leadership

Jan 5, 2026

[]

[]

2025 has been a defining year for onocoy, marked first and foremost by
strong financial and institutional validation of the project. A
significant milestone was achieved in Q2/25 with the acquisition of our
first two B2B clients, securing recurring real revenue ahead of the
Token Generation Event (TGE). 2025 was also the launch of a successful
PinkSale presale, raising over $139,000 to bootstrap decentralized GNSS
infrastructure and demonstrate early market confidence (read more). This
was followed by the implementation of token vesting with Streamflow
(read more), establishing disciplined token economics designed for
long-term sustainability rather than short-term speculation.

That foundation was further strengthened by a strategic investment from
Ryze Labs, reinforcing external conviction in onocoy’s vision,
technology, and execution. Together, these steps created the conditions
for a confident Token Generation Event, marking the official launch of
$ONO and enabling the network to scale rapidly with aligned incentives
across miners, users, and stakeholders.

Complementing private capital and strategic investment, onocoy also
secured a $1.5M grant from the European Space Agency, supporting the
development of AI-powered GNSS fraud detection and underscoring
institutional trust in the robustness and relevance of onocoy’s
technology. This combination of community funding, venture backing, and
public-sector support laid a uniquely strong foundation for growth
throughout 2025.

2025 was a year onocoy focused on expanding its ecosystem through a
growing set of technology, distribution, and application partners.
Throughout the year, collaborations with Tupaia, NeuraLoc, RTKFix,
SkyTrade, WeatherXM, Acurast, Stargate, and Septentrio strengthened the
onocoy’s market position and enabled new use cases across robotics,
autonomous,, and enterprise GNSS. In parallel, distribution partnerships
with DroneDash, Kindhelm, and EUGEO accelerated regional adoption,
enabling rapid coverage expansion in key markets such as Southeast Asia,
Finland, and Romania. Together, these partnerships translated onocoy’s
decentralized architecture into real-world deployments and commercial
traction.

As the network grew, 2025 also marked a shift toward smarter incentives
and product maturity. Rather than rewarding scale alone, onocoy began
aligning miner incentives with reliability and real demand. The
introduction of Streak Appreciation encouraged long-term, consistent
performance, helping stabilize the network as coverage expanded
globally.

This was complemented by High Value Areas (HVAs), which guided growth
toward regions with active client demand, ensuring that new coverage
translated directly into real-world usage. Together, these mechanisms
allowed the network to scale efficiently while maintaining
professional-grade reliability.

Looking ahead, the upcoming local usage rewards will further strengthen
this model by directly linking miner rewards to actual correction usage
in their area, reinforcing a self-sustaining loop between demand,
quality, and incentives.

The results were striking. Our miner base grew from 3725 in January to
over 7,500+ by December, while DC credits burnt by clients surged from
25,266 to 411,161, demonstrating strong adoption and reliance on
onocoy’s GNSS services data. $ONO buybacks and burns exceeded 1.7
million, reflecting both token utility, reliability for the long term
and active ecosystem participation. These numbers highlight that
onocoy’s growth isn’t just in scale but a deep engagement and tangible
network impact. To provide full transparency into our network activity,
we have built a Dune Dashboard.

Beyond metrics, we also strengthened thought leadership and community
engagement. Guides like “Your Guide to Understanding the $ONO Token”
(link) and interviews with Co-founder Thomas Nigg (link) helped users
understand our mission, while articles on blockchain’s role in GNSS
(link) and fraud prevention (link) positioned onocoy as a thought leader
driving innovation in the space.

Looking ahead to 2026, we aim to turn growth into direct benefits for
our community:

- Demand growth, expanding enterprise, B2B, and Web3 usage to drive
  higher network utilization and shared value for miners, hodlers, and
  the community

- Release Usage rewards feature to incentivize active participation

- RINEX generation and archiving to provide professional-grade GNSS data

- Continuous stability improvements, including enhanced fraud detection
  supported by ESA NAVISP

- Referral programs and mass provisioning of miners and user devices to
  accelerate adoption

- Web3 partnerships in robotics, connecting decentralized GNSS to
  autonomous systems and applications

The achievements of 2025 triple-digit miner growth, fast deployment of
over 7,550 stations, strategic partnerships, product innovation, and
strong tokenomics provide a solid foundation to make 2026 even bigger
for onocoy and the decentralized GNSS ecosystem.

We close 2025 by thanking our incredible community, dedicated miners,
partners, and everyone who believed in our vision your trust and support
have made this remarkable journey possible, and together we will
continue building the future of decentralized GNSS.
