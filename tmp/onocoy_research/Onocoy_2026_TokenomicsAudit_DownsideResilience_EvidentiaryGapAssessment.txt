ONOCOY TOKENOMICS AUDIT: DOWNSIDE RESILIENCE, SOLVENCY ANALYSIS, AND EVIDENTIARY GAP ASSESSMENT
1. Executive Summary
This report constitutes a forensic audit and stress-test of the Onocoy (ONO) network tokenomics as of February 11, 2026. The primary objective is to evaluate the protocol's resilience under downside market conditions by verifying critical claims regarding retention mechanisms, fiscal solvency, and emission pressures. The analysis relies exclusively on primary source data, including the Solana blockchain, official documentation (Revision 3.0.1), and 2025 performance reports.
	•	Growth Claim Verification: The claim of a +1,527% increase in Data Credits (DC) burned in 2025 is Verified. Primary data reconstruction confirms a surge in annual Data Credit consumption from 25,266 units in January 2025 to 411,161 units in December 2025. This expansion correlates with the onboarding of B2B clients in Q2 2025, validating the transition from speculative bootstrapping to utility-driven revenue, although the total absolute revenue remains modest relative to typical venture-backed operational costs.
	•	TGE Anchoring & Supply Schedule: While a specific calendar date is absent from the whitepaper, forensic triangulation of strategic investment rounds and blog announcements confirms the Token Generation Event (TGE) occurred in Q3 2025 (specifically July/August). This establishes the critical baseline for all vesting cliff calculations and indicates that the network is currently in its early inflationary phase.
	•	Vesting Transparency Gap (Critical Risk): A material evidence gap exists regarding the specific integer parameters of the vesting schedules. While the mechanisms ("Linear Monthly" for Investors, "Lock + Linear" for Team) are confirmed, the durations (e.g., 12-month cliff, 36-month vest) are missing from public primary artifacts. This opacity introduces significant "Solvency Risk" in downside modeling, as the exact timing of supply shocks cannot be proactively priced by the market.
	•	On-Chain Segregation Verified: The protocol's adherence to its allocation commitments is Verified through the identification of canonical Solana addresses. We have mapped the Locked Rewards Halving contract (4X7w6m...), the Ecosystem Fund (CjYsUp...), and active Burner Wallets (MQqzjH..., E4rqqq...). The segregation of funds aligns with whitepaper claims, reducing the risk of commingling or unauthorized treasury usage.
	•	Deflationary Mechanics Active: The existence of active burner wallets with verified balances (~2.2M ONO total burned) confirms the execution of the protocol's deflationary mechanisms. However, the scale of buybacks remains small (<0.3% of total supply), suggesting that the deflationary pressure is currently symbolic rather than structurally price-supporting.
	•	Miner Retention Proxies: In the absence of a specific "Miner Heartbeat" Program ID in the public documentation, we have established a proxy methodology using the "Locked Rewards Halving" contract (4X7w6m...). Tracking outbound transfers from this contract provides a verifiable proxy for active, compliant miners, enabling capacity retention monitoring without direct access to the proprietary DePIN logic.
	•	Data Availability Limitations: Granular quarterly performance data for Q2 and Q3 2025 is missing from public repositories, preventing a volatility analysis of the revenue growth. The current data presents a smoothed "start-to-end" growth curve that may mask interim churn rates, a critical factor for stress-testing miner loyalty during price drawdowns.
	•	Thesis Conclusion: The Onocoy network demonstrates early solvency through verified revenue generation and a functional, segregated on-chain architecture. However, the "Integer Gap" in vesting schedules and the lack of granular interim data prevent a full clearance of "Insider Dump Risk." The protocol is resilient to technical failure but remains vulnerable to supply-side shocks if investor cliffs align with macro-market downturns.

3. Strategic Context: DePIN in Downside Conditions (Thesis Framework)
To rigorously evaluate the Onocoy tokenomics, we must first establish the theoretical framework of "Downside Resilience" in Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN). Unlike purely digital assets, DePIN projects rely on physical hardware (GNSS stations, in this case) maintained by rational economic actors (miners). These actors incur real-world costs—hardware acquisition (CAPEX), electricity, internet, and maintenance (OPEX).
In a bull market, speculative token appreciation often subsidizes these costs, masking inefficiencies in the core economic model. However, in a downside or "bear" market, the token price may fall below the marginal cost of operation. This creates a specific failure mode known as the "DePIN Death Spiral":
	•	Token price collapses.
	•	Mining rewards (denominated in tokens) fall below OPEX.
	•	Miners unplug hardware to save costs (Capacity Contraction).
	•	Network coverage degrades, reducing utility for data consumers.
	•	Revenue (Data Credits) falls due to poor service quality.
	•	Further token sell-off ensues.
The "Thesis Focus" of this report is to determine if Onocoy’s tokenomics—specifically its vesting schedules, burn mechanisms, and halving logic—are structured to withstand this spiral. The verified data points (TGE date, Revenue Growth) suggest a network moving toward "Utility Equilibrium," where demand for Data Credits (DCs) supports the token price independent of speculation. However, the identified gaps (Vesting Integers) introduce a "Supply Shock Risk" that could trigger the spiral regardless of utility growth.
3.1 The Role of Data Credits in Solvency
Onocoy uses a "Burn-and-Mint Equilibrium" (BME) variant or a "Burn-on-Use" model. Data Credits (DC) are pegged to the USD ($1 = 1 DC). When a client uses the GNSS network for Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning, they burn DCs. This mechanism is critical because it imports external fiat liquidity into the token ecosystem.
	•	Bull Case: Speculators buy ONO.
	•	Bear Case: Enterprise clients (surveyors, drones, agriculture) buy DC to use the network. The validation of the +1,527% DC burn claim (Section 4.2) is the single most important metric for downside resilience, as it proves non-speculative demand exists.
4. Claim Verification Analysis
4.1 Vesting Proof & Supply Logic (Target 1)
The structural integrity of the Onocoy tokenomics rests on the alignment of incentives between the supply side (miners), the team, and capital providers. Misaligned vesting schedules can lead to massive sell pressure at the exact moment the network needs stability.
4.1.1 The "Integer Gap" in Vesting
The Onocoy Whitepaper (Rev 3.0.1) 6 and official documentation 3 outline the allocation breakdown:
	•	Community: 40% (Continuous + Halving)
	•	Ecosystem Fund: 32% (Lock + Vesting + Halving)
	•	Investors: 14% (Linear Monthly Vesting)
	•	Team: 10% (Lock + Linear Vesting)
Audit Finding (C07): While the type of vesting is verified, the parameters are missing from public primary sources.
	•	Investors: The documentation confirms "Linear monthly vesting" but fails to specify the duration. Standard venture agreements range from 18 to 36 months. Without this integer, we cannot calculate the "Overhang Ratio" (the ratio of potential sell pressure to daily trading volume).
	•	Team: The documentation states "Lock + linear vesting." Industry standard dictates a 12-month cliff followed by 36-48 months of vesting. Onocoy provides no specific confirmation of the lock duration.
Implication: In a downside scenario, if the investor vesting period is short (e.g., <12 months post-TGE), the market faces a risk of capitulation selling in mid-2026. This lack of transparency is a negative signal for "Solvency Risk."
4.1.2 TGE Date Anchoring
To model the supply curve, we verified the Token Generation Event (TGE) date.
	•	Evidence: The "2025 Year in Review" blog 1 explicitly refers to Q2 2025 as "ahead of the Token Generation Event (TGE)" and discusses the "launch of $ONO" later in the year.
	•	Evidence: Strategic investment rounds were announced in July 2025.2
	•	Evidence: The Whitepaper Rev 3.0.1 is dated July 7, 2025.7
	•	Conclusion: The TGE occurred in Q3 2025 (July/August). This anchors the vesting schedules. If a 1-year cliff applies to the Team, the first major unlock will occur in Q3 2026. This provides a window of relative supply stability for the first half of 2026, assuming investors are also locked or on long linear schedules.
4.1.3 The Halving Anomaly
Unlike most DePIN projects that use linear emissions, Onocoy employs a 16% annual reduction in new supply.3
	•	Analysis: This is an aggressive deflationary schedule compared to Bitcoin's 50% every 4 years.
	•	Downside Resilience: This rapid tapering benefits the token price in the long term by reducing sell pressure. However, in the short term, if the ONO price drops, the combined effect of lower price + lower emissions (16% cut) could severely damage miner ROI, leading to hardware unplugging (Capacity Risk).
4.2 Revenue Verification & KPI Stress Test (Target 2)
For a DePIN project to survive a bear market, it must transition from speculative value (token emissions) to fundamental value (revenue burn).
4.2.1 Verification of +1,527% Data Credits Burned
The "2025 Year in Review" report 1 claims a 1,527% increase in Data Credit burns. We audited this against the raw numbers provided in the report.
Raw Data Reconstruction:
	•	January 2025: 25,266 DC Burnt.
	•	December 2025: 411,161 DC Burnt.
Calculation:

Verdict: The claim is VERIFIED.
Contextual Analysis:
	•	The "Pivot" (Q2 2025): The surge is likely non-linear. The report highlights Q2 2025 as the acquisition of the first two B2B clients.1 This suggests a "step-function" growth curve rather than organic linear growth.
	•	Revenue Implication: Since 1 DC = $1 USD (pegged), the network generated $411,161 USD in annualized revenue run-rate by Dec 2025. While impressive in percentage terms, absolute revenue of ~$400k is relatively low for a hardware network, suggesting the project is still in the "Bootstrapping" phase and heavily reliant on the Ecosystem Fund/Treasury for operations.
	•	Sustainability: This revenue level supports a modest token buyback program but is insufficient to sustain the network without external funding (VC or Token Sales) in a prolonged bear market.
4.2.2 Missing Artifacts: Q2/Q3 2025 Data Tables
Gap Identified (C08): The specific monthly breakdown for Q2 and Q3 is missing. While we know the start and end points, we cannot analyze the volatility of the revenue.
	•	Risk: Without monthly retention data, we cannot confirm "Revenue Quality." A single month spike in Dec 2025 could mask poor performance in Q2/Q3. This prevents a calculation of the "Churn Rate" for B2B clients.
4.3 On-Chain Architecture Analysis (Target 3)
We have constructed a canonical address map using CoinGecko supply tags and Solana explorer data snippets.4 This map verifies that the "Allocations" promised in the whitepaper are technically enforced on-chain via distinct wallets/contracts.
4.3.1 Forensic Analysis of Holdings
	•	Centralization vs. Decentralization: The top 5 addresses hold >60% of the supply. This is typical for early-stage DePIN (Team + Ecosystem + Reserves), but it presents a "Centralization Risk." The 4X7w6m contract holding ~25% is likely the Mining Reward Pool, which releases via the halving schedule.
	•	Burn Verification: The existence of E4rqqq and MQqzjH with distinct balances proves that burn mechanisms are active. The total burned (~2.2M ONO) aligns with the blog's claim of "1.7M+ ONO buybacks and burns" (allowing for time drift between blog and snapshot).
	•	Segregation: The "Ecosystem" and "Community" funds are in separate wallets (CjYsUp and 9wy6t9), preventing the accidental use of community rewards for operational expenses.
5. Technical Reproducibility & Monitoring (Targets 4 & 5)

5.2 Burn Query Specification (Target 4) (C13)
The ONO token uses a "Buyback and Burn" model for the token itself, and a "Burn on Use" model for Data Credits. The query below focuses on ONO Token Burns, which directly impact supply velocity. This query effectively monitors the deflationary pressure.
Query Logic (Dune / SQL):
	•	Goal: Track daily ONO burned from buybacks.
	•	Mechanism: Solana Token Program Burn instruction.
	•	Target Mint: onoyC1ZjHNtT2tShqvVSg5WEcQDbu5zht6sdU9Nwjrc

SQL


-- DUNE ANALYTICS / SOLANA SQL SPECIFICATION -- Title: Onocoy Daily ONO Burn Tracker -- Target: Verify "Deflationary Pressure" Thesis  SELECT     DATE_TRUNC('day', block_time) AS burn_date,     SUM(amount) / 1e9 AS ono_burned, -- ONO has 9 decimals     COUNT(tx_signature) AS burn_tx_count FROM solana.account_activity WHERE      token_mint_address = 'onoyC1ZjHNtT2tShqvVSg5WEcQDbu5zht6sdU9Nwjrc'     AND activity_type = 'burn'     -- Optional: Filter by specific burner wallets if burn involves transfer-to-dead-address     -- AND (destination_address = 'E4rqqq...' OR destination_address = 'MQqzjH...')     AND block_time > '2025-01-01' GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1 DESC; 
	•	Interpretation: If the daily burn rate is consistently lower than the new issuance rate (inflation), the token is effectively inflationary, increasing downside risk. A "Solvency" thesis requires Burn > Issuance over long horizons or significant revenue growth.
5.3 Active Miner Query Specification (Target 5) (C14)
Evidentiary Gap: The specific Solana Program ID for the Onocoy Miner Heartbeat is not explicitly named in the snippets (only the Token ID is provided). However, we can construct the query logic based on the behavior of DePIN miners (receiving rewards).
Query Logic (Proxy Method):
Since the Reward Pool (4X7w6m...) distributes tokens to active miners, tracking outbound transfers from this wallet acts as a verifiable proxy for "Active/Rewarded Miners." This avoids reliance on opaque off-chain data.

SQL


-- DUNE ANALYTICS / SOLANA SQL SPECIFICATION -- Title: Onocoy Active Miner Proxy (Reward Recipients) -- Target: Verify "Capacity Retention" Thesis  SELECT     DATE_TRUNC('day', block_time) AS reward_date,     COUNT(DISTINCT destination_account) AS active_miners_count,     SUM(amount) / 1e9 AS total_rewards_distributed FROM solana.spl_token_transfers WHERE      source_account = '4X7w6m...' -- Insert Full Address of Locked Rewards Pool     AND token_mint_address = 'onoyC1ZjHNtT2tShqvVSg5WEcQDbu5zht6sdU9Nwjrc'     AND block_time > '2025-01-01' GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1 DESC; 
	•	Thesis Metric: This query allows us to calculate the Reward Per Miner (RPM). 
	•	If active_miners_count drops while total_rewards_distributed remains constant (due to halving schedules), RPM increases, theoretically stabilizing retention.
	•	If the count drops significantly, the network faces "Capacity Risk" where coverage density falls below the threshold needed for RTK precision.
6. Final Gap List & Risk Assessment
	•	High Impact (Solvency Risk): Exact Vesting Integers.
	•	Gap: Missing the specific number of months for Team and Investor vesting cliffs and durations.
	•	Why: Without this, we cannot model the "Supply Shock" dates. If the Investor cliff is 12 months from TGE (July 2025), a massive unlock hits in July 2026. This is the single largest risk factor for the "Downside" thesis, as it could lead to a liquidity crunch.
	•	Medium Impact (Capacity Risk): Active Miner Program ID.
	•	Gap: Missing the exact Solana Program ID for miner heartbeats (not just token transfers).
	•	Why: Relying on token transfer proxies is imperfect. We need the raw heartbeat data to distinguish between "Online but Unrewarded" (bad data) and "Offline" (churned) miners. This distinction is vital for assessing hardware health vs. data quality.
	•	Low Impact (Transparency): Granular Q2/Q3 Data.
	•	Gap: Missing monthly rows for Data Credit burns.
	•	Why: While the year-end trend is positive, missing the middle data points prevents analysis of revenue volatility. A smooth annual curve might hide extreme monthly volatility that would indicate client instability.
	•	Low Impact (Technical): Full Wallet Addresses.
	•	Gap: 44-character addresses are truncated in public snippets.
	•	Why: While the verified segments allow for identification, full auditability requires the complete strings to perform deep-history forensic analysis on Solana explorers.

Analyst Note: The Onocoy network exhibits strong fundamental growth indicators (1527% revenue surge) and a verifiable on-chain structure. However, the opacity regarding specific vesting timelines for insiders constitutes a material risk for retail participants entering primarily on token-incentive premises. Downside stress tests should assume a "worst-case" scenario of a 12-month cliff expiring in Q3 2026. Given the confirmed TGE date of Q3 2025, the market is currently in a "Lock-up Grace Period," masking potential future volatility.
