Availability Scale

[]

What it is

A daily metric that shows how reliably your station delivers data. It
blends:

- 

  Uptime

- 

  Data completeness while connected (“Data rate”).

Result: a score between 0 and 1. Higher is better.

[]

How it works

Availability Scale = Uptime Score × Data rate

[]

Uptime Score:

- 

  0 at 80% uptime and lower

- 

  1 at 100% uptime

- 

  Increases exponentially between 80% and 100%.

A daily Uptime Grant is awarded to all miners. See Daily Uptime Grant
below.

[]

Data rate:

- 

  Completeness during connected periods

- 

  Data rate = valid received epochs(*) / expected epochs

- 

  Result between 0 and 1

* Epochs which include satellite measurements and properly terminated
epochs.

This keeps the metric fair: uptime captures liveness; data rate captures
delivery quality while you’re live.

[]

Daily Uptime Grant

We always add a minimum of 5 minutes on top of your daily uptime to
account for brief maintenance periods. onocoy measures its own downtime,
so this can be more in case of longer outages.

Here is the calculation (one day has 86400 seconds):

- 

  Uptime_graced = (Uptime in seconds + 300 seconds) / 86400 seconds

Note: Uptime_graced can never be higher than 1.

Short story: if you’re close to perfect, the grant simply ensures minor
hiccups don’t tank your score. If you’re far from perfect, the grant
won’t mask real downtime.

[]

Uptime Score mapping

The uptime is now mapped to a score that represents the value for the
onocoy network.

- 

  If Uptime_graced ≤ 80% → Uptime Score = 0 (insufficient liveness)

- 

  If Uptime_graced = 100% → Uptime Score = 1 (perfect)

- 

  Between 80% and 100% → UptimeScore grows exponentially from 0 toward 1
  with increasing sensitivity near 100%. Here are some examples:

  - 

    0.25 at 90% uptime

  - 

    0.90 at 99% uptime

  - 

    0.98 at 99.8% uptime

[]

Example calculation

Uptime:

- 

  Day length: 86,400s

- 

  Actual online time: T_onl = 85,000s

- 

  Add uptime grant: T_onl_graced = min(86,400; 85,000 + 300) = 85,300s

- 

  Uptime_graced = 85,300 / 86,400 = 98.7%

- 

  Mapping to Uptime Score: 98.7% uptime → 0.877 Uptime Score

Data rate:

- 

  Expected are 85,000 valid epochs to be received

- 

  Received are 84,000 epochs

- 

  Datarate = 85,000 / 84,000 = 0.9882

Availability Scale:

- 

  Availability = Uptime Score × Data Rate = 0.877 × 0.9882 = 0.867

This is your final Availability Scale.

Where to find it

Open your Reference Station on the explorer[] to see the Availability in
your “Base Reward” chart.

[]

Tips to improve

- 

  Stable power and internet

- 

  Good antenna placement and receiver settings

- 

  Avoid restarts

- 

  Watch your connected-time completeness (Data rate) and minimize packet
  loss

[]

Notes

- 

  Parameters (e.g., grace, curve shape) may be adjusted to keep
  incentives sustainable; watch official updates.

- 

  Data rate only measures completeness while connected; uptime already
  accounts for offline time.
