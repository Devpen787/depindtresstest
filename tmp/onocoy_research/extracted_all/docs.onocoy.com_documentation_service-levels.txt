way you save on the base fee and pay only for the PPU for each
additional device.

Key features

NRBY_ADV is a roaming mountpoint. That means:

- 

  Your rover receiver will automatically connect to the nearest station

- 

  It will only connect to those stations fulfilling your signal band
  requirements

  - 

    For example, if you choose signal Galileo E5 as a must for you, you
    will only receive correction data from base stations tracking E5.

- 

  If you move further than 20 km from the original base station and
  another suitable station is closer, the receiver will automatically
  change the base station to the closer one.
