Configure the GNSS receiver

Now you just need to configure your receiver.

Click on Connect in the last column of the credential list to view the
details you have to put in for your receiver:

- 

  Use the username and password generated in the step “Create
  credentials for your device”, visible in the list of your credentials

- 

  Configure the NTRIP caster to point to clients.onocoy.com and port
  2101

  - 

    Use port 2121 for TLS connections

- 

  Choose mountpoint NRBY_ADV

This is a roaming mode mountpoint. It will deliver data from the closest
reference station matching your configuration of the credential. For
this to work, you will have to enable NMEA (GGA) back messages in your
GNSS rover.

We support NTRIP protocol version 1.0 and 2.0.

These generic instructions should help to enable NTRIP client
functionality. Please consult the documentation of the respective
receiver manufacturer for further detailed instructions on how to
configure the parameters above.

You are good to go!

Your device should now start streaming GNSS correction data from the
onocoy NTRIP caster.

Back in the console, under NTRIP Clients[], you should see connection
details from the connected device(s) you have configured by clicking on
the credential name.

If you have any questions, send a message to [email protected][] for
assistance.
