How to Claim

[]

Manually Claim ONO Tokens to Your Wallet

As a recipient, you can easily withdraw your unlocked ONO tokens from a
vesting or payment contract directly to your wallet. 10% of the $ONOs
from the presale will be unlocked at TGE, and from then on 1% is
unlocked every day. Don't worry, you don't have to claim every day,
whenever you claim you will get the amount that has built up.

Note: You have to expect a fee from the provider of 0.01 SOL per claim.
Once the contract has completed, all remaining ONO tokens will be
automatically claimed to the recipient’s wallet.

Step 1: Go to the Streamflow Website or App

Visit the Streamflow website[] or App and select either "Vesting" or
"Payments".

Auto-Claim ONO Tokens to Your Wallet

With Auto-Claim, there’s no need to manually claim your ONO tokens as
they unlock. Instead, they are automatically sent to your wallet, with
the sender covering the transaction fees.

🗣 Important: If the recipient’s wallet address is from a centralized
exchange, activating Auto-Claim is mandatory to ensure proper delivery
of ONO tokens.
