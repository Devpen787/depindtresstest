Setting of the credentials

Create credentials for your device

In order to use onocoy RTK Service, you will need to set up a
credential, consisting of a username, password, and configuration (GNSS
system, frequency bands). One credential can be used for multiple
devices. It is also possible to create multiple credentials, each with a
different configuration.

Go to NTRIP Clients[] and click on Add new credential. Fill in a
password and optionally a description for your new credential. Note: the
username will be generated automatically.

Select the reference frame of choice that best suits your location and
intended data use. For further details please see our section Select a
reference frame.

[]

Select a reference frame in the dropdown.

If desired, select the GNSS system and minimum signals you require. Only
stations with at least those signals will be chosen for your GNSS
correction data. Beware that this means all stations not meeting your
requirements will be excluded from providing data to you. You can always
change these settings later.

Select the minimum required signals, only do this if necessary.

One last step! To activate credentials, subscribe to the onocoy RTK
service. Click on Enable now on the bottom to start your 30 day plan and
immediately deduct 20 Data Credits from your account. Now you’re all
set!

The credentials can also be activated at a later moment by clicking the
“Enabled” switch in the list of active credentials.

After activating the service it will automatically renew every 30 days.
You have the possibility to stop the service by disabling the credential
and according to the conditions in the Terms of Service[].
