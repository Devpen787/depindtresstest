🛰️ What is onocoy?

onocoy is a decentralized platform that enables the global,
community-driven distribution of high-precision GNSS (Global Navigation
Satellite System) correction data.

It’s built on Web3 technologies (blockchain, tokens, smart contracts) to
allow anyone—individuals, businesses, or institutions—to contribute to
and benefit from a global network of GNSS reference stations.

🌐 What Problem Is onocoy Solving?

High-precision GNSS positioning (like centimeter-level GPS accuracy)
requires correction data from Continuously Operating Reference Stations
(CORS).

Today’s issues:

- 

  Expensive and centralized infrastructure.

- 

  Limited coverage (mainly wealthy urban/agricultural areas).

- 

  Proprietary standards and vendor lock-ins.

- 

  Exclusion of developing regions from accessing this technology.

💡 How Does onocoy Work?

🧱 1. Decentralized GNSS Reference Stations

Anyone can set up a GNSS station (a "miner") and stream correction data
to onocoy.

💰 2. Token-Based Incentives (ONO Token)

Operators earn ONO tokens based on:

- 

  Quality of data,

- 

  Uptime,

- 

  Geographic location (under-served areas earn more),

- 

  Actual usage of their data.

🔍 3. Validator Network

To ensure only authentic, high-quality GNSS data is rewarded, onocoy
uses a decentralized validator system to detect fake or low-quality
signals.

🔗 4. Web3 Infrastructure

- 

  Powered by the Solana blockchain.

- 

  Uses smart contracts for reward distribution and governance.

- 

  Supports open GNSS protocols (NTRIP, RTCM) to ensure interoperability.

🧠 5. Community Governance

onocoy is a non-profit Swiss association. Its direction is governed by
token holders using square-root voting, ensuring a fair and
decentralized decision-making process.

🚀 What Makes onocoy Unique?

- 

  DePIN for GNSS: A decentralized physical infrastructure network for
  location services.

- 

  Open and inclusive: Supports open standards, no vendor lock-in.

- 

  Mass-market ready: Enables affordable pay-per-use correction data for
  everyone.

- 

  Equity and access: Brings high-precision positioning to under-served
  and remote areas.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔮 Vision

  onocoy wants to make high-precision positioning as ubiquitous and
  accessible as Wi-Fi — for autonomous vehicles, smart agriculture,
  disaster response, climate monitoring, and more.
