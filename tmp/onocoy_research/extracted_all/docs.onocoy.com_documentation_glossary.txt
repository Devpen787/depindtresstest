Here’s a glossary for the ONOCOY: Enabling Mass Adoption of High
Precision GNSS Positioning Using Web3 whitepaper (Version 2.0.0). It
includes key technical, economic, and organizational terms from the
document:

📖 Glossary

A

- 

  Availability Scale: A component of miner rewards based on the
  continuity and completeness of GNSS data streams.

B

- 

  Base Reward: A fixed reward given to GNSS data contributors (miners)
  independent of actual data usage.

- 

  Blockchain: A decentralized digital ledger used in onocoy for
  governance, token economy, and transaction records.

C

- 

  CORS (Continuously Operating Reference Station): A GNSS reference
  station that streams data continuously to support high-precision
  positioning.

- 

  Cryptoeconomic Design: The token-based incentive system used by onocoy
  to ensure fair participation, reward distribution, and sustainability.

- 

  Caster: A system component that distributes GNSS correction data in
  real-time to users.

D

- 

  Data Credit: A non-transferable token pegged to fiat value, used to
  access GNSS data streams within onocoy.

- 

  DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network): A web3 model
  for building physical infrastructure through tokenized, community
  participation.

- 

  Decentralization: Distribution of decision-making, validation, and
  system control across the community, reducing reliance on central
  authorities.

E

- 

  Early Mover Boost: An incentive multiplier in the base reward for
  early contributors/miners.

- 

  Ecosystem Fund: A portion of token revenues reserved for development
  and maintenance of the onocoy system.

F

- 

  FIAT: Traditional government-issued currency (e.g., USD, EUR), used as
  a price anchor for data credits.

G

- 

  GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System): A system that provides
  geolocation and time information via satellite constellations (e.g.,
  GPS, Galileo).

- 

  Governance: The decision-making framework for managing the onocoy
  system, including token-holder voting and Swiss association oversight.

L

- 

  Location Scale: A reward modifier that encourages spatial distribution
  of GNSS stations by penalizing clustering.

M

- 

  Miner: A participant who operates a GNSS reference station,
  contributing data to the onocoy platform.

- 

  MQTT: A lightweight messaging protocol used in the onocoy
  communication backbone.

N

- 

  NTRIP (Networked Transport of RTCM via Internet Protocol): A protocol
  used to stream GNSS correction data.

- 

  Non-transferable Token: A token that cannot be traded or resold, used
  within a closed system like data credits in onocoy.

O

- 

  ONO Token: A capped, deflationary utility token used to incentivize
  participation and governance in the onocoy network.

- 

  Oracle: A mechanism that ensures stable fiat pricing for data credits
  by adjusting ONO-token exchange rates.

P

- 

  PPP (Precise Point Positioning): A GNSS technique that provides
  high-precision positioning using correction models.

- 

  Proof-of-Stake: A consensus mechanism proposed for validators to
  establish trust and ensure data quality in decentralized systems.

Q

- 

  Quality Scale: A reward component measuring GNSS data quality based on
  signal type, precision, and consistency.

R

- 

  RTK (Real-Time Kinematic): A high-precision GNSS technique that uses
  data from a nearby reference station to correct position estimates.

- 

  Reward Commission: The entity responsible for setting base reward
  values and modifiers in onocoy’s tokenomics.

S

- 

  Smart Contract: Self-executing code deployed on the blockchain, used
  to manage transactions and governance rules in onocoy.

- 

  Spoofing: A malicious practice of transmitting fake GNSS signals to
  deceive receivers.

- 

  Synthetic Measurements: Artificial GNSS data mimicking real signals,
  considered fraudulent in the onocoy context.

T

- 

  Teal Organization: An organizational model based on self-management,
  wholeness, and evolutionary purpose—used by onocoy’s core team.

- 

  Tokenomics: The study and design of onocoy’s token economy, including
  supply, distribution, and incentives.

U

- 

  Usage Reward: A performance-based reward given to miners whose
  stations are used more frequently by customers.

V

- 

  Validator: A participant responsible for verifying the authenticity
  and quality of GNSS data using advanced statistical and geospatial
  methods.
