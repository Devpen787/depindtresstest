1.  3. Become a Miner

Hardware recommendations

You will need a GNSS receiver and antenna in order to be able to mine
rewards. onocoy is hardware-agnostic, meaning it can work with any type
of receiver and antenna, provided they meet the technical requirements.

Onocoy does not sell its own hardware. Here are a few recommendations
from our partners[]:

Some remarks if you want to DIY or bring your own:

- 

  For maximizing rewards, a triple- or quad band GNSS receiver that
  supports all of the major constellations (GPS, Galileo, Beidou and
  Glonass) is required.

- 

  GNSS receivers with a lower number of supported frequency bands (e.g.
  only L1+L2, or L1+L5) will receive rewards, albeit at a lower level
  than triple/quad band receivers

- 

  A high quality GNSS antenna which supports the receiver’s frequency
  bands.

- 

  The GNSS receiver should either directly support connection to an
  Ethernet/Wifi network, or be connected to a host (Raspberry Pi, ESP32,
  or equivalent) that acts as a bridge.

- 

  The receiver must have "NTRIP Server" functionality.

- 

  Please note that GNSS receivers only receive signals, hence, there is
  no additional electromagnetic transmission originating from operating
  the receiver.
