What are HVAs?

High Value Areas (HVA) are incentives for miners to deploy and operate
new stations in areas particularly sought after by users. They are
time‑boxed reward boosts over a specific geographical area. onocoy
configures the campaign; the community deploys and operates stations.

[]

How it works for you

Deploy and operate a qualifying station inside (or near) an active HVA.
The HVA adds a temporary multiplier on top of your base rewards while it
runs; the rewards at the edges of the HVA fade with a soft gradient to
avoid hard borders. The exact amount of rewards can be checked with the
reward estimator tool.

Your station will be qualified for the HVA bonus rewards if it meets the
daily availability and quality scores. The rewards are added up each
day, forming your HVA streak. If your station misses the scores on one
day, your streak is going to be reduced (similar to Streak
Appreciation).

Phases

Growth phase: a short ramp while your streak proves the station is
viable.

Earning phase: enjoy the maximum multiplier.

Dissolving phase: when an HVA budget comes close to its end, rewards
taper with a visible daily cap (e.g. −5% per day) to soften the landing.

The length of the phases depends on the maximum multiplier of the HVA
(e.g. 2x or 5x) and the available budget allocated to the HVA. This may
be different for each HVA.

Remember that in case your streak is reduced, you may be set back, e.g.
from the earning phase to the growth phase.

Check your bonus rewards (green part of the chart) in your rewards
chart. In this example, the station is within the growth phase.

Where to find it and what to do

Watch HVA areas on the Opportunity Map in the console using the Reward
Estimation Tool: each one shows the area, start and expiration, and the
dedicated budget. Then deploy/relocate into the zone and keep your
station in‑spec to maintain your streak.

[]

Use the Reward estimator tool to check the maximum bonus for each HVA
and the remaining budget.
