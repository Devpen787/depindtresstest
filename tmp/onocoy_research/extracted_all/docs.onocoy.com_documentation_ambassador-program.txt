Ambassador Program

Welcome to the onocoy Ambassador Program — our way of empowering early
contributors who want to support the future of decentralized positioning
infrastructure (DePIN). This program activates passionate community
members across three key verticals: Tech, Brand, and Community.

Purpose

The Ambassador Program is designed to:

- 

  Grow a trusted group of contributors across technical, marketing, and
  community areas.

- 

  Increase awareness, credibility, and traction in the DePIN and Web3
  infra ecosystems.

- 

  Reward high-value contributors with recognition, tokens, and early
  access.

We use a tiered system with defined roles, tracked KPIs, and a
structured onboarding process. Entry is open but selective: we
prioritize commitment, quality, and alignment.

What We Provide

All onocoy Ambassadors receive access to the resources, tools, and
support they need to succeed in their role:

- 

  Templates & Assets: Co-branded visuals, guide templates, and content
  resources.

- 

  Tracking Tools: KPI submission forms, dashboards, and performance
  logs.

- 

  Communication Channels: Group chats with the core team and fellow

- 

  Guides & Documentation: Onboarding scripts, FAQs, and moderation
