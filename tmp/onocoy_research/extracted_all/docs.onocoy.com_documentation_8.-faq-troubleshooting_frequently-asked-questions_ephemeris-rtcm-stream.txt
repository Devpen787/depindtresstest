Ephemeris RTCM stream

In addition to the streams available from onocoy dedicated to provide
the raw GNSS observables to perform RTK or DGNSS positioning, onocoy
also also provides a special RTCM stream that does not come from a base
station which provides the navigation messages / ephemeris of all the
GNSS satellites orbiting planet Earth.

This stream allows you to compute, for instance, a positioning solution
when combined with another RTCM stream coming from a base station, for
that you would require special software like RTKNavi from RTKlib.

Please note that the Ephemeris RTCM stream detracts data credits at the
same rate than any other standard RTCM stream from a base station.

The message types provided in the stream are:

- 

  RTCM Message type 1019 which contains GPS ephemeris.

- 

  RTCM Message type 1020 which contains GLONASS ephemeris.

- 

  RTCM Message type 1042 which contains BeiDou ephemeris.

- 

  RTCM Message type 1045 which contains Galileo F/NAV ephemeris.

- 

  RTCM Message type 1046 which contains Galileo I/NAV ephemeris.

Ephemeris stream considerations:

1.  

    A client needs to be able to handle bulk data as it is around 10kB
    sent in one go.

2.  

    If the NTRIP client stays connected, it will continue to receive
    updated ephemeris as it becomes available. This typically happens
    every 30 minutes, but is more frequent for some of the
    constellations.

3.  

    In order to avoid the NTRIP Client running into a timeout after
    initial delivery, we are sending out "Keepalive" messages every 15
    seconds. These Keepalives are in RTCM1029 format, and a payload text
    saying "No new data".

If you want to access this stream please search for the "EPHEMERIS"
mountpoint in the NTRIP source table.
