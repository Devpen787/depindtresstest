Head back to your receiver firmware

On the receiver side, make sure to follow these steps:

Enable NTRIP server functionality for NTRIP 2.0 devices (see
instructions NTRIP 1.0 below)

- 

  Configure the NTRIP caster to point to servers.onocoy.com, port 2101.

- 

  For the mountpoint name, you can choose any alphanumeric text you
  like. This is only informative and will show up in your dashboard, not
  publicly. It will also help you identify which server device is which.

- 

  For username and password, enter the credentials for your device as
  created in Step 2.

Enable the right NTRIP messages

- 

  Enable RTCM3, MSM Messages 1005, 1077, 1087, 1097, 1117, 1127, 1137
  and 1230 in the reference station receiver.

  - 

    onocoy supports MSM4/5/6/7 messages

- 

  Activate them to be sent out at 1Hz rate (except for message 1005,
  which can be configured for a much lower rate, for example once every
  30 seconds).

- 

  Enable all GNSS constellations and bands the receiver supports.
  Typically, receivers are preconfigured to this already.

NTRIP 1.0 devices

- 

  For NTRIP 1.0-only devices (for example ESP32 XBee based units such as
  Ardusimple NTRIP servers), please enter the NTRIP username as
  MOUNTPOINT and password into the password field. Leave the device's
  username field, if any, empty.

[]

You are good to go!

Go back to the explorer. After one minute you should see a new entry
under NTRIP Servers[] and its location on the map. You should also see
live operational parameters of the station you just have configured.
