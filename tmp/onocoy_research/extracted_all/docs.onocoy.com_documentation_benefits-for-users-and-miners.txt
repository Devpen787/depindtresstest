Benefits for users and miners?

[]

👥 For RTCM Data Users (e.g. GNSS device users, service providers)

[]

✅ 1. Global Access to High-Quality Data

- 

  Access a globally distributed network of RTCM streams (based on open
  standards like RTCM3 over NTRIP).

- 

  Useful for applications like precision agriculture, autonomous
  vehicles, surveying, and more.

- 

  No need to deal with fragmented, regional providers.

[]

💸 2. Affordable Pay-Per-Use Model

- 

  No expensive annual subscriptions (which can cost
  $200–$50,000/year/device).

- 

  onocoy uses data credits for pay-per-use pricing — perfect for scaling
  across mass-market devices and new geographies.

[]

🟢 3. Open and Interoperable

- 

  Compatible with any standard GNSS hardware — no vendor lock-in.

- 

  Encourages modular system design (users can pick the best device and
  the best data source separately).

[]

🔄 4. Real-Time, Single-Base RTK Support

- 

  Users get low-latency, high-accuracy corrections from the nearest
  station.

- 

  Especially valuable for use cases like robotic navigation, drone
  flight, or automated farming.

[]

🌍 5. Access in Under-Served Regions

- 

  onocoy’s incentive model motivates miners to deploy stations in
  underrepresented areas (e.g., rural Africa or South America).

- 

  Users can benefit from coverage where none existed before.

[]

🧑‍🌾 For Miners (GNSS station operators)

[]

💰 1. New Revenue Streams

- 

  Earn ONO tokens based on:

  - 

    Signal quality

  - 

    Uptime

  - 

    Usage of the station

  - 

    Underserved location bonus

- 

  No need to build a user base — onocoy handles demand aggregation.

[]

🛠 2. Easy Integration

- 

  Use existing GNSS hardware and standard protocols (NTRIP, RTCM).

- 

  No proprietary software or expensive new systems required.

[]

🔍 3. Real-Time Quality Monitoring

- 

  Validators provide automated feedback on data quality, availability,
  and performance.

- 

  Helps miners maintain high standards and optimize station performance.

[]

🗺 4. Location-Based Incentives

- 

  Miners are rewarded more for deploying stations in areas with low
  coverage or high potential demand.

- 

  This encourages smart network growth, not just clustering in
  profitable urban areas.

[]

🌐 5. Community and Ecosystem Participation

- 

  Miners become part of a global, decentralized GNSS infrastructure
  movement.

- 

  Unlike being a cog in a closed system, onocoy allows miners to
  contribute to open, humanity-serving applications (e.g., disaster
  monitoring, climate tracking).
