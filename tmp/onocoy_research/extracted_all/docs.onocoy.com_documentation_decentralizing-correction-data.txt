Decentralizing correction data

onocoy contributes to the decentralization of GNSS correction data by
fundamentally transforming how GNSS infrastructure is built, owned, and
operated. Here’s a breakdown of how onocoy achieves this
decentralization:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]

🚀 1. Community-Powered GNSS Infrastructure

Instead of relying on a few centralized correction service providers,
onocoy enables anyone to operate a GNSS reference station (CORS) and
stream correction data in exchange for tokens. This allows:

- 

  A broader geographic spread of stations.

- 

  Participation from individuals and organizations outside the
  traditional GNSS industry.

- 

  Reduced infrastructure redundancy and costs, compared to centralized
  models which often over-serve profitable areas and under-serve the
  rest of the world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]

🧠 2. Use of Web3 and Blockchain for Trust & Coordination

onocoy leverages blockchain and smart contracts to create a
decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN):

- 

  Token incentives (ONO token) reward station operators and validators.

- 

  Smart contracts manage rewards, data validation, and governance
  transparently.

- 

  Non-transferable data credits, pegged to fiat value, ensure
  predictability for customers while separating speculation from service
  access.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔍 3. Validator Network for Data Quality

To prevent bad actors from submitting fake or synthetic GNSS data just
to earn tokens, onocoy deploys a decentralized validator network that:

- 

  Monitors data quality using physical and statistical properties of
  GNSS signals.

- 

  Validates measurements with real-time and post-processed checks.

- 

  Provides real-time alerts and quality scoring for reference station
  operators.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔓 4. Open Standards for Interoperability

Unlike many legacy providers who rely on proprietary protocols, onocoy:

- 

  Supports open standards (e.g., RTCM3 over NTRIP).

- 

  Avoids vendor lock-in.

- 

  Allows integration with existing and new equipment, fostering
  compatibility and network growth.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

🧩 5. Separation of Infrastructure and Services

Traditional GNSS correction services are vertically integrated—tying
hardware, infrastructure, and services together. onocoy decouples these
layers:

- 

  Reference stations become part of a shared infrastructure.

- 

  Correction service providers can use onocoy’s data without having to
  build their own network.

- 

  This opens doors for mass-market and emerging region applications.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

🌍 6. Enabling Global Coverage and Equity

onocoy’s model:

- 

  Lowers barriers to entry for contributors and users.

- 

  Creates potential for GNSS correction availability in under-served
  regions like Africa, South America, and rural Asia.

- 

  Supports humanitarian and scientific applications such as earthquake
  early warning, climate monitoring, and global navigation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]

📈 7. Progressive Decentralization & Governance

onocoy’s governance includes:

- 

  Square-root voting to prevent power concentration.

- 

  Delegated voting by token holders.

- 

  Long-term goal of a fully community-controlled infrastructure via its
  Swiss-based nonprofit association.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In essence, onocoy democratizes the GNSS correction ecosystem, breaking
the monopoly of legacy players and fostering a scalable, transparent,
and collaborative alternative powered by community incentives and open
protocols.
