Streak Appreciation

[]

What it is

Streak Appreciation boosts your daily reward when your station performs
well on back‑to‑back days. The longer the streak, the bigger the boost.

[]

How it works

Each day that meets the requirements adds +1 to your streak. Miss a day
and your streak is halved (rounded down).

[]

What you need to hit (today).

Availability Scale ≥ 0.98

Quality Scale ≥ 0.80

[]

What you get

The multiplier grows in a straight line up to +50% over the base reward.
You will reach that cap at 125 qualified days in a row, after that it
stays flat. Your daily reward is your base reward plus the boost from
this multiplier.

[]

If you miss a day

Example 1: Your streak is 51 days. You miss a day → your streak becomes
25 days. Your multiplier drops from approximately 20% to 10%.

Example 2: Your streak is 250 days. You miss a day → your streak becomes
125 days. Your multiplier stays at the max (+50%), because 125 is the
amount of days needed to reach the max bonus.

Where to find it

Open your Reference Station on onocoy’s explorer[] to view your current
streak and multiplier.

FAQ: Why does my bonus reward not go up, even though my station
qualifies?

onocoy will calculate the rewards accurately every day, but update the
rewards on chain only if they significantly change (up or down).

Example: This chart illustrates bonus rewards allocated to a station. In
the first highlighted phase, there is no significant change of the total
rewards, neither an increase or decrease. On the 8th day, there is a
significant increase of the total rewards, prompting an update of the
rewards on chain.

[]

onocoy updates the rewards only after a significant change to them.
