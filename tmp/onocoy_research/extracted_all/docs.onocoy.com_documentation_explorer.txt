Explorer

[]

The heatmap shows which areas are well covered to receive GNSS
correction data.

The explorer[] is a tool to discover the coverage of onocoy's GNSS
corrections. It is very useful for miners and clients equally.

Open the explorer and you will find a map of the earth with a heatmap on
where to find coverage. Zoom in and out to inspect your different areas
of interest.

If you zoom in enough, you can click on a specific miner. You will see
more detailed information about the station.
