onocoy's mining rewards system is designed to incentivize both the
rollout and maintenance of GNSS reference stations (called miners). The
reward model includes four components, each based on different
performance and network factors:

[]

1. Base Reward

Every miner gets a base reward (in ONO) for participating—this is
independent of actual usage and encourages early infrastructure
deployment.

Components of Base Reward:

- 

  Daily ONO Base Reward:

  - 

    Determined by the rewards commission

  - 

    Indicates the maximum amount of ONO a miner can earn within the Base
    Reward

  - 

    Will be multiplied by the following factors:

- 

  Quality Scale:

  - 

    onocoy checks the quality of the submitted data daily

  - 

    The quality is based on:

    - 

      Supported GNSS constellations (e.g., GPS, Galileo, BeiDou, etc.)

    - 

      Frequency bands supported (e.g., L1, L2, L5, L6)

    - 

      Measurement metrics (e.g., cycle-slip-free epochs, signal noise)

- 

  Availability Scale:

  - 

    Data uptime and completeness

  - 

    Uptime must be ≥80% to earn any reward; scaling is exponential up to
    100%

- 

  Location Scale:

  - 

    Rewards optimal distribution (not clustered)

  - 

    Penalties for redundancy over three stations within 15–50 km radius

  - 

    Rewards sparsely covered areas to encourage useful deployments

- 

  Early Mover Boost:

  - 

    Multiplier (initially 5×) applied to early adopters

  - 

    Declines over time

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]

2. Streak Appreciation

Additional incentives to:

- 

  Reward early adoption

- 

  Keep up high performance

- 

  Drive infrastructure upgrades

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]

3. High Value Areas

Additional incentives (temporary) to:

- 

  Support targeted network growth

- 

  Deploy new stations quickly in a highly demanded area

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]

4. Usage Rewards

This is a bonus based on actual data consumption in a region. It is
currently planned for the future and not active yet.

- 

  Shared among miners in a region based on:

  - 

    How often their data is accessed

  - 

    The improvement their data offers to users (e.g., signal quality)

- 

  Encourages regional collaboration: miners benefit more if the region
  is actively used.

Goal: Encourage miners to not just deploy anywhere, but to find
high-impact, high-use locations.
