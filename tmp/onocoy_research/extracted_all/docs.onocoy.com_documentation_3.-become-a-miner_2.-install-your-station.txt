Installation guide

[]

Now that you have your device, it's time to install it.

[]

Assemble your station

Follow the station-specific instructions to assemble the receiver and
antenna.

Have an NTRIP-X? Then follow this installation guide[].

[]

Which location is optimal?

- 

  Choose an installation location in an area no closer than 20km to the
  next onocoy station.

- 

  With 3 or more stations in close proximity, rewarding will be scaled
  down for those stations.

- 

  You can easily check the distance to the next onocoy station for any
  location with the Explore[] function.

What should the surroundings be like?

- 

  Ideally, the antenna has a 360-degree view of the sky, with no
  obstructions (buildings, trees, mountains) above an elevation of 10
  degrees.

- 

  A simple way to check this is to make a fist and stretch the arm
  horizontally. Hold the lower side of the fist in line with the
  horizon, and the upper side indicates about 10 degrees above the
  horizon when the arm is held perfectly horizontal.

- 

  If sky visibility is limited or there is a lot of multipath in the
  signal, rewards will be scaled down.

- 

  Please note that the antenna must be rigidly mounted. Even under heavy
  weather conditions, it shouldn't move more than 1-2 millimeters. The
  location of the antenna is continuously monitored by the onocoy
  validators. If there are too many vibrations or the antenna is moved,
  rewards will be paused.

What about the internet connection?

- 

  You need a stable, permanent connection to the Internet.

- 

  The bandwidth requirements are quite low. A well-configured receiver
  should not require more than around 1 kB/s.

- 

  There is no inbound traffic.

- 

  With typical firewalls, no ports need to be opened, as the connections
  are established inside-out.
