# Getting data credits

You would like to receive onocoy's data via NTRIP? Great! Here is how it works.

### **Create an account**

To use our services, you must have an onocoy account.\
If you don't already have one, head over to the [onocoy explorer](https://console.onocoy.com/explorer), click on ***Register now*** and create a user account. You will be notified by email when your account is activated.

### Top up your Data Credits

Data Credits (DC) are the way of payment at onocoy. In order to access the services, you must first purchase Data Credits through your account.&#x20;

To receive GNSS correction data from onocoy, you first have to Top Up your Data Credits for the first time. Go to NTRIP Clients and click on ***Buy Data Credits**,* the following pop-up window will open.<br>

Select the amount you would like to top up your account with. Next, insert your credit card and billing information. If you have a coupon code, you can apply it in this step.&#x20;

After checkout, you will see in the top right corner your updated Data Credit amount.

If you would like to see your payment and invoice history, click on your account email in the top right of the header, select **Settings** and choose the **Billing** tab. Open the **Billing Dashboard** to receive access to your invoices and payment methods.&#x20;

We previously also offered to swap DC for BONO tokens, which were the Beta ONO tokens. Unfortunately, we are unable to provide this method at the moment due to regulatory constraints. We will announce immediately when this method becomes available again.

### How much Data Credits do I need? — Our data plans

Which amount to top up? Here is how our price plan works.

Fees are deducted in credits from your account and consist of:

* Base subscription fee. The recurring fee is deducted in advance every 30 days, plus &#x20;
* Pay-per-use fee. Deducted in real-time and for the time you actually will use the Services ("Pay-per-use").&#x20;

The base subscription fee for the 30 days data plan is 20 Data Credits. In addition, every hour of GNSS correction data is 0.15 Data Credits. This is the pay-per-use fee. Hence, 25 Data Credits will be enough for one month of subscription plus more than 30 hours of GNSS correction data in that month. Please note that a refund of Data Credits is not possible.

Upon purchase, you will be able to receive onocoy RTK data as long as there are enough data credits on your account. Every 30 days, the base fee will be automatically deducted from your account. Therefore, you need to make sure there is enough credit on your account. For more details regarding data usage and termination please refer to our [Terms of Service](https://onocoy.com/terms-of-service).
