# Swapping BONO to ONO

TGE (token generation event), the moment we've all been waiting for, is around the corner. It is going to be the moment where onocoy will start giving out ONOs instead of BONOs, which was the test token for early contributors.&#x20;

## How can early miners exchange their BONOs to ONOs and how do they benefit?

💡 Here are the most important points in short:

1. The average **exchange rate** between BONO to ONO is **1:8**. That means you get 8 ONOs for 1 BONO on average over time.
2. **The longer you wait, the higher the exchange rate!** The exchange rate will increase over time. That means, people who wait will benefit more.
3. There will be a swapping tool in the onocoy explorer. Using this, you will be able to select the amount to swap from BONO to ONO.

This approach is in everybody's best interest as

* it rewards the early miners for their loyalty extraordinarily,
* gives miners full flexibility to choose when they want to swap,
* avoids a token supply shock at TGE and thus supports price stability at ONO.

## How does the mechanism behind the swapping work exactly?

* onocoy creates an **ONO pool** to reward BONO holders (especially early miners)
* We fill the pool with **8** times more ONO than there are BONOs in circulation
* 4 million ONO (\~19%) from this pool is unlocked at TGE, the rest will be unlocked continuously with daily unlocks
* The unlocking schedule corresponds to a halving over 3 years (or about 21% per year)

* BONO holders can exchange their BONO for ONO at any time
* The swap rate is determined at conversion time by dividing the number of unlocked ONO in the pool by the number of circulating BONO
* Converted BONO are burned, while the ONO are taken out of the pool and transferred to BONO holders, with the ONO being unrestrictedly tradable.

## How does the exchange rate increase over time?

The conversion rate is determined by the number of unlocked ONO divided by the number of circulating BONO. This means two things:

1. As more ONOs will be unlocked over time, more ONOs will be available to be swapped and the conversion rate increases.
2. As more and more BONOs will be burnt, the rate of ONOs per BONOs will be higher, i.e. the conversion rate increases.&#x20;

Let's look at an example how it *could* play out. For that, we need to assume a few things.

Let's assume that at TGE, 20% of BONOs will be exchanged immediately and after that, 20% of the remaining BONOs each year. In the following graph, you can see how the exchange rate will evolve.

Using these assumptions, the exchange rate is growing continuously every year. That means, those who wait will get a more favourable exchange rate than those who swap immediately.

## What happens to the BONO tokens that I haven't claimed yet?

No worries, the BONO tokens that you haven't claimed yet will be auto-claimed after TGE. Until TGE, your station will still earn BONOs. After TGE, all your unclaimed BONO tokens will be automatically transferred to your connected wallet.&#x20;

## How to swap BONO to ONO in the explorer?

1. Find the **Claim ONO** button on the main page of the explorer.

2. Open the claiming tool and type in how many BONOs you would like to convert.

3. Play around with the bar to see how many ONOs you'll get in the future. You will get information about the following values:
   1. **Minimum ONO if you convert in x years**: This is the amount of ONO tokens you'll receive if you swap in the future instead of now. Move the button on the scale to check out how the values increase if you wait longer. \
      Note: The amount you will get in x years will most likely be higher as early swappers won't benefit from future token unlocks.
   2. **Theoretical Max**: This is the amount you can theoretically receive after all ONOs are unlocked. For this calculation of the exchange rate, the current amount of circulating BONOs is used. This means that if other people trade in their BONOs, this value will even go up.
   3. **If you convert now, you'll receive**: This the amount of ONO tokens you will receive if you swap now. The calculation is based on the amount of unlocked ONOs divided by the number of currently circulating BONOs.
   4. **You're missing out on**: This is the amount you will miss if you convert now instead of trading it for the theoretical maximum.\
      Most likely you will miss out on even more, because in the mean time others will swap before you, which makes the conversion rate more advantageous for you.
4. Hit the checkbox to confirm you accept the Terms and Conditions for GNSS Reference Station Data Providers.
5. Click **I'll come back later for more ONOs** or **Convert Now Anyway**.
6. If you did convert, confirm the transaction in your wallet.
7. You should see your ONOs appear in your wallet.
