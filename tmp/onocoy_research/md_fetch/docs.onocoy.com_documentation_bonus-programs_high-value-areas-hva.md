### What are HVAs?

High Value Areas (HVA) are incentives  for miners to deploy and operate new stations in areas particularly sought after by users. They are time‑boxed reward boosts over a specific geographical area. onocoy configures the campaign; the community deploys and operates stations.

### How it works for you

Deploy and operate a qualifying station inside (or near) an active HVA. The HVA adds a temporary multiplier on top of your base rewards while it runs; the rewards at the edges of the HVA fade with a soft gradient to avoid hard borders. The exact amount of rewards can be checked with the reward estimator tool.

Your station will be qualified for the HVA bonus rewards if it meets the daily availability and quality scores. The rewards are added up each day, forming your HVA streak. If your station misses the scores on one day, your streak is going to be reduced (similar to Streak Appreciation).

### Phases

Growth phase: a short ramp while your streak proves the station is viable.

Earning phase: enjoy the maximum multiplier.

Dissolving phase: when an HVA budget comes close to its end, rewards taper with a visible daily cap (e.g. −5% per day) to soften the landing.

The length of the phases depends on the maximum multiplier of the HVA (e.g. 2x or 5x) and the available budget allocated to the HVA. This may be different for each HVA.

Remember that in case your streak is reduced, you may be set back, e.g. from the earning phase to the growth phase.

Check your bonus rewards (green part of the chart) in your rewards chart. In this example, the station is within the growth phase.

#### Where to find it and what to do

Watch HVA areas on the Opportunity Map in the console using the Reward Estimation Tool: each one shows the area, start and expiration, and the dedicated budget. Then deploy/relocate into the zone and keep your station in‑spec to maintain your streak.

#### How HVA differs from Streak Appreciation

| HVA                                  | Streak Appreciation  |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| has a start and end date             | always on            |
| has a defined geographical area      | network‑wide         |
| has a dedicated budget               | boosts daily rewards |
| settings can differ per HVA campaign | uniform parameters   |

Expect HVA multipliers to be much higher than Streak Appreciation’s cap.

Parameters may evolve over time — follow official updates.
