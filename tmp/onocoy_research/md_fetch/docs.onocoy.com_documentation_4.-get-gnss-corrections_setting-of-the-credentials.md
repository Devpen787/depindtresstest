# Setting of the credentials

### **Create credentials for your device**

In order to use onocoy RTK Service, you will need to set up a credential, consisting of a username, password, and configuration (GNSS system, frequency bands). One credential can be used for multiple devices. It is also possible to create multiple credentials, each with a different configuration.

Go to [NTRIP Clients](https://console.onocoy.com/clients) and click on ***Add new credential***. Fill in a password and optionally a description for your new credential. Note: the username will be generated automatically.

Select the reference frame of choice that best suits your location and intended data use. For further details please see our section [*Select a reference frame*](https://docs.onocoy.com/documentation/8.-faq-troubleshooting/frequently-asked-questions/explaining-datum-shifts#new-feature-select-a-reference-frame)*.*

If desired, select the GNSS system and minimum signals you require. Only stations with at least those signals will be chosen for your GNSS correction data. Beware that this means all stations not meeting your requirements will be excluded from providing data to you. You can always change these settings later.

### Select data plan

One last step! To activate credentials, subscribe to the onocoy RTK service. Click on ***Enable now*** on the bottom to start your 30 day plan and **immediately** deduct 20 Data Credits from your account. Now you’re all set!

The credentials can also be activated at a later moment by clicking the “Enabled” switch in the list of active credentials.

After activating the service it will automatically renew every 30 days. You have the possibility to stop the service by disabling the credential and according to the conditions in the [Terms of Service](https://www.onocoy.com/terms-of-service-1).
